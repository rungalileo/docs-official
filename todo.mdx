# Documentation Completion TODO List

This document outlines all incomplete sections of the documentation website that require attention, organized by priority level.

## High Priority Items

These items are critical for user onboarding and core functionality understanding:

1. **Complete Getting Started Section**

   - [ ] `getting-started/how-to-use-galileo.mdx`: Expand the existing content with more detailed steps and examples

2. **Complete Core How-to Guides**
   - [ ] `how-to-guides/conversational-ai/instruction-adherence.mdx`: Add missing screenshots of updated metrics and prompt perplexity section
   - [ ] `how-to-guides/conversational-ai/reducing-hesitation-and-uncertainty.mdx`: Add example of using Galileo to evaluate Uncertainty and trigger response changes
   - [ ] `how-to-guides/rag/basic-example.mdx`: Replace placeholder comment with actual RAG retrieval implementation

3. **Complete SDK Documentation**
   - [ ] `sdk-api/python/overview.mdx`: Research and add OTEL support information
