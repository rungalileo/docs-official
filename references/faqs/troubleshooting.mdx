Welcome to the Galileo troubleshooting guide. This guide addresses common issues users may encounter when working with the Galileo SDK, API, Console, and overall integration process.

---

## SDK Setup and Configuration

### Problem: <span style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>SDK fails to initialize</span>

**Causes:**

- SDK is out of date or improperly installed
- Environment variables are improperly configured

**Solutions:**

- Confirm Galileo is installed and check its version:
    - **Python:** `pip show galileo`
    - **TypeScript:** `npm list galileo`
- Reinstall the SDK:
    - **Python:** `pip install galileo`
    - **TypeScript:** `npm install galileo`
- Double-check `.env` configuration, making sure that API keys are correct, the keys are named correctly, and loaded via tools like `dotenv`.

## API Connectivity and Authentication

### Problem: <span style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>401 Unauthorized when calling Galileo APIs</span>

**Causes:**

- API keys are out of date or entered incorrectly
- Environment variables are improperly configured

**Solutions:**

- Re-generate your API token from the [Galileo Console](https://app.galileo.ai/settings/api-keys)
- Double-check `.env` configuration, making sure that API keys are correct, the keys are named correctly, and loaded via tools like `dotenv`.

### Problem: <span style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>API requests timing out</span>

**Causes:**

- Internet connectivity issues
- Payload size in request exceeds limits

**Solutions:**

- Ping Galileo endpoints to check latency using `ping api.galileo.ai` or `curl -I https://api.galileo.ai`.
- Validate your internet connection by visiting other websites or performing a speed test.
- Retry using a minimal payload by simplifying your API request body to the required fields only.
- Verify you're not exceeding rate limits by checking error response headers for limits.
- Consider implementing exponential backoff for retry logic, using libraries like `axios-retry` or custom retry mechanisms.

## Integration Issues

### Problem: <span style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>Rate limit issues</span>

**Causes:**

- Some metrics rely on OpenAI APIs or other external APIs which have their own rate limits
- Some agents rely on external APIs which have their own rate limits

**Solutions:**

- Request higher rate limits from OpenAI for your organization.
- Use different API keys or organizations for separate projects or environments (e.g., production vs. pre-production) to distribute load.


### Problem: <span style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>JSON parsing errors</span>

**Causes:**

- Some metrics rely on OpenAI or other API responses being valid JSON

**Solutions:**

- Retry the metric computation as transient errors may cause invalid JSON.
- Check the output format of the model you're using in its provider's documentation, such as [OpenAI's](https://platform.openai.com/docs/).

## Galileo Console UI

### Problem: <span style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>Console UI not loading</span>

**Causes:**
- Browser extensions are interfering with [Galileo Console](https://app.galileo.ai)
- Browser cache and cookies are interfering with [Galileo Console](https://app.galileo.ai)

**Solutions:**

- Clear browser cache and reload by opening browser settings and selecting "Clear Cache and Site Data".
- Try accessing the Console in incognito mode to rule out extension or cookie conflicts.

### Problem: <span style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>Logging data not appearing in Console UI</span>

**Causes:**
- Incorrect Project name or Log Stream name
- GalileoLogger or Traces not properly configured in application
- Failing to conclude or flush the GalileoLogger

**Solutions:**
- Confirm that the Project and Log Stream names in the UI match the names used when invoking the `GalileoLogger` or using `galileo_context` in your application code.
    <CodeGroup>
    <SnippetTroubleshooting1 />
    </CodeGroup>

- In your application code, ensure the `GalileoLogger` is properly initialized and [Traces](/concepts/traces) are configured correctly.
    <CodeGroup>
    <SnippetTroubleshooting2 />
    </CodeGroup>

- At the end of your application code, ensure the `GalileoLogger` is concluded and logs are flushed.
    <CodeGroup>
    <SnippetTroubleshooting3 />
    </CodeGroup>

### Problem: <span style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>Spans appearing as separate Traces</span>

**Causes:**
- Spans not encapsulated within a Workflow Span
- Traces invoked multiple times without concluding and flushing logs

**Solutions:**
- Create a [Workflow Span](/concepts/spans) to act as a parent Span before logging other Spans.
    <CodeGroup>
    <SnippetTroubleshooting4 />
    </CodeGroup>

- Ensure [Traces](/concepts/traces) are concluded and flushed after creating Spans, and look for loops in your application code that may invoke Traces multiple times.
    <CodeGroup>
    <SnippetTroubleshooting5 />
    </CodeGroup>

### Problem: <span style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>Ground truth metrics are not appearing (e.g. BLEU, ROUGE)</span>

**Causes:**
- Dataset is missing an "output" column
- No Ground Truths are provided

**Solutions:**
- Check your experiment to confirm that your [Dataset](/concepts/datasets) has an "output" column. If it does not, add one.
- Metrics may appear to be missing because they do not apply to Log Streams. With Log Streams, no [Ground Truths](/concepts/metrics/response-quality/ground-truth-adherence) are provided.
