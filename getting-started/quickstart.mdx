Welcome to Galileo! This quickstart guide will walk you through setting up **your first AI evaluation in minutes**. You'll learn how to identify and fix common issues in AI responses using Galileo's powerful metrics and insights.

### **What You'll Learn**

- Set up and run an AI evaluation with Galileo in less than 5 minutes
- Interpret key metrics to identify response quality issues
- Apply prompt engineering techniques to fix common AI response problems
- Understand how Galileo helps you build more reliable AI applications

<Steps>

<Step title="Create Project Folder">

Create a new project folder and navigate to it in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
mkdir first-AI-evaluation
cd first-AI-evaluation
```

```bash TypeScript
mkdir first-AI-evaluation
cd first-AI-evaluation
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Install Dependencies">

Install the **Galileo SDK** with OpenAI support and the dotenv package using the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
pip install "galileo[openai]" python-dotenv
```

```bash TypeScript
npm install galileo dotenv --save
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Project Files">

In your project folder, create a new blank application file and `.env` file:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
first-AI-evaluation/
â”‚â”€â”€ app.py
â”‚â”€â”€ .env
```

```typescript TypeScript
first-AI-evaluation/
â”‚â”€â”€ app.ts
â”‚â”€â”€ .env
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Set Up Environment Variables">

In the `.env` file, add the following credentials:

```text
GALILEO_API_KEY=your-Galileo-api-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-OpenAI-api-key-here
GALILEO_PROJECT=My first project
GALILEO_LOG_STREAM=physics-questions
```

</Step>

<Step title="Log in to the Galileo Console">

To access your Galileo API keys, open the [Galileo Console](https://app.galileo.ai) and log in or create an account.

The **Galileo Console** is the hub for viewing all your Galileo projects, configuring your experiments, and viewing your logged data.

</Step>

<Step title="Fill in API Keys">

In the `.env` file, fill in the API key values:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` : Obtain your OpenAI API key by logging in to your OpenAI account on [their website](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).
- `GALILEO_API_KEY` : Obtain your Galileo API key by logging in to your Galileo account on [Galileo.ai](https://app.galileo.ai/settings/api-keys). Open "Settings & Users" from the drop down menu in the top-right corner. Then, click "API Keys" in the left column, and generate your API key by clicking "+ Create new key".

</Step>

<Step title="Application Code">
Copy the code below into your application file:

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetGettingStarted1Python />
<SnippetGettingStarted1Typescript />
</CodeGroup>

If you are using TypeScript, you will also need to configure your code to use ESM, so add the following to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  ... // Existing contents
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Run the Application">

To run this simple application, simply run the following:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
python app.py
```

```typescript TypeScript
npm install tsx
npx tsx app.ts
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="View Results in Terminal">

**Congratulations!** You have run your first AI inference using the **Galileo SDK**.

You can see the model's output in your terminal. Next, you'll use the [Galileo Console](https://app.galileo.ai) to see even more details.

<Card>
<ResponseField name="The Model's Response">
Newton's First Law, often referred to as the Law of Inertia, states that an object will remain at rest, or in uniform motion in a straight line, unless acted upon by a net external force. This means that if an object is not influenced by any external forces, it will maintain its current state of motion. Essentially, this law emphasizes the concept of inertia, which is the natural tendency of objects to resist changes in their motion. It forms the foundation for classical mechanics, outlining the behavior of objects when forces are not in play.

<Note>Your application is now connected to Galileo with Metrics ðŸŽ‰! You can continue to explore on your own or read more about improving the prompt.</Note>

### **Fixing prompt issues**

If you examine the results we got for our first run, you'll see that the model's response is not exactly what we asked for.

#### **What Happened?**

- We asked for a **succinct** explanation.
- The model gave a **detailed** answer instead. ðŸ˜¢
- Our **instruction adherence metric was 0.6667%**, meaning we need to tweak our prompt.

To understand **why** our instruction adherence metric was so low, we can look at the **metric explanation**. You can find this explanation by clicking the LLM node in the Trace steps on the left, and then mousing over the instruction adherence percent output.

![Metric Explanation](/images/console-ui/instruction-adherence-explanation.png)

<Card>
  <ResponseField name="Metric Explanation">
    The instruction provided was to 'Explain the following topic succinctly:
    Newton's first law'. The response begins by defining Newton's First Law and
    provides a clear explanation of the concept of inertia. However, the
    response is lengthy and provides more detail than the word 'succinctly'
    implies. While it does effectively cover the essence of the topic, it could
    be more concise to align better with the instruction. Thus, while
    informative, the response does not fully adhere to the request for a
    succinct explanation.
  </ResponseField>
</Card>

This explanation correctly points out that the answer we got wasn't exactly succinct. So, let's modify our prompt to fix this. We'll make sure to explain _what succinctness means for us_.

To do this, replace the prompt in your application file with a new prompt:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# app.py

prompt = """

1. Explain Newton's First Law in one sentence of no more than fifteen (15)
   words.
2. Do not add any additional sentences, examples, parentheses, bullet
   points, or further clarifications.
3. Your answer must be exactly one sentence and must not exceed 15 words.
   """

```

```typescript TypeScript
// app.ts

const prompt = `
1.	Explain Newton's First Law in one sentence of no more than fifteen (15)
    words.
2.	Do not add any additional sentences, examples, parentheses, bullet points,
    or further clarifications.
3.	Your answer must be exactly one sentence and must not exceed 15 words.
`;
```

</CodeGroup>

Running this again, our results will look much more concise:

Now, our **instruction adherence metric jumps to 1**! ðŸŽ‰
