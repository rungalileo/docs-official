There are several concepts which will you'll encounter when logging with Galileo.
1. The **Galileo Logger** - This is the main object you'll use to log data from your application. You can access it directly using the <a href="">Python</a> or <a href="">TypeScript SDKs</a>.
2. **<a href="/concepts/projects">Project</a>** - All logs are stored within a project in Galileo. You can create and manage your projects using the Galileo UI.
3. **<a href="/concepts/logstreams">Log Streams</a>** - Log streams are a way to organize logs in Galileo. You can create and manage your log streams using the Galileo UI.
4. **<a href="/concepts/traces">Traces</a>** - These track a collection of Logs which represent a "single response". For multi-step LLM calls, this helps debug how the response was built, and where issues may have occurred.
5. **<a href="/concepts/spans">Spans</a>** - Spans are a single step in a trace. They can be a `workflow` if they contain multiple sub-spans, `llm` for a step invoking an LLM call, `retriever` for when you retrieve data, or `tool` for agentic tool calls. 

As your application runs, it will stream logs back to Galileo in a series of traces that then get analyzed using Metrics you set up. Traces that seem problematic can then be reviewed step by step to determine what part of the pipeline needs changing, or if the Metrics need tweaking.
