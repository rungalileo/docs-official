**Datasets** are a fundamental building block in Galileo's experimentation workflow. They provide a structured way to **organize, version, and manage** your test cases. Whether you're evaluating prompts, testing application functionality, or analyzing model behavior, having well-organized datasets is crucial for systematic testing and continuous improvement.

You have two ways to work with datasets in Galileo. For detailed information about dataset management, see our [Datasets Documentation](/sdk-api/python/experimentation/datasets):

1. **Use Galileo's Dataset Feature**
   - Maintain and organize your test data directly in Galileo
   - Track which inputs cause problems
   - Automatically group similar issues

2. **Bring Your Own Dataset**
   - Import your existing test data
   - Use your own data organization
   - Keep your existing workflow

### Creating Focus Sets

When you find problems, you can:
1. Create subsets of data that trigger specific issues
2. Track how well your fixes work on these subsets
3. Make sure fixes don't cause new problems
4. Build a library of test cases for future testing

### Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with basic testing, then expand
2. **Group Issues**: Create focused datasets for similar problems
3. **Track Progress**: Monitor how changes affect both specific issues and overall performance
4. **Keep History**: Save problematic inputs to prevent regressions


## Creating and Growing Your Dataset

When building your test suite, you'll often start with a core set of test cases and expand them over time as you discover new edge cases or scenarios. Galileo makes this process seamless by allowing you to create datasets and add to them incrementally:

<CodeGroup>
```python create_dataset.py
from galileo.datasets import create_dataset

test_data = [
    {
        "input": "Which continent is Spain in?",
        "expected": "Europe",
    },
    {
        "input": "Which continent is Japan in?",
        "expected": "Asia",
    },
]

dataset = create_dataset(
    name="countries", 
    data=test_data,
    project="my-project",
)
```

```typescript create_dataset.ts
// Coming soon...
```
</CodeGroup>

As you discover new test cases, you can easily add them to your dataset:

<CodeGroup>
```python create_dataset.py
dataset = get_dataset(
    name="countries",
    version=3, # if this param isn't specified, it defaults to the latest
    project="my-project",
)

dataset.insert([
    {
        "input": "Which continent is Morocco in?",
        "expected": "Africa",
    },
    {
        "input": "Which continent is Australia in?",
        "expected": "Oceania",
    },
])
```

```typescript create_dataset.ts
// Coming soon...
```
</CodeGroup>
## Version Management and History

One of the key benefits of Galileo's dataset management is automatic versioning. This allows you to track how your test suite evolves over time and ensures reproducibility of your experiments. You can always reference specific versions of a dataset or work with the latest version:

<CodeGroup>
```python get_dataset.py
from galileo.datasets import get_dataset

# Get the latest version by default
dataset = get_dataset(
    name="countries",
    project="my-project",
)

# Check when this version was last modified
print(dataset.modified_at)

# Review the history of your dataset
versions = dataset.get_version_history()

# Access an older version for comparison or regression testing
oldest_version = get_dataset(
	name="countries",
	version=versions[-1].version
	project="my-project"
)
```

```typescript get_dataset.ts
// Coming soon...
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices for Dataset Management

When working with datasets in Galileo, consider these tips:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a core set of representative test cases
2. **Grow Incrementally**: Add new test cases as you discover edge cases or failure modes
3. **Version Thoughtfully**: Use versioning to track major changes in your test suite
4. **Document Changes**: Keep track of why you added certain test cases or created new versions
5. **Organize by Purpose**: Create separate datasets for different types of tests (e.g., basic functionality, edge cases, regression tests)

By following these practices and utilizing Galileo's dataset management features, you can build a robust and maintainable test suite that grows with your application's needs.

List the versions of a dataset and grab a particular version:

```python
from galileo.datasets import get_dataset

dataset = get_dataset(
    name="countries",    
    project="my-project",
)

print(dataset.modified_at)

versions = dataset.get_version_history()

oldest_version = get_dataset(
	name="countries",
	version=versions[-1].version
	project="my-project"
)
