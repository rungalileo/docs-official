### WorkflowStep

A workflow step is the atomic unit of logging to Galileo. They represent a single execution of a workflow, such as a chain, agent, or a RAG execution. Workflows can have multiple steps, each of which can be a different type of node, such as an LLM, Retriever, or Tool.

You can log multiple workflows in a single request. Each workflow step must have the following fields:

- `type`: The type of the workflow.
- `input`: The input to the workflow.
- `output`: The output of the workflow.

## Examples

### LLM Step

```json
{
  "type": "llm",
  "input": "What is the capital of France?",
  "output": "Paris"
}
```

### Retriever Step

```json
{
  "type": "retriever",
  "input": "What is the capital of France?",
  "output": [{ "content": "Paris is the capital and largest city of France." }]
}
```

### Multi-Step

Workflow steps of type `workflow`, `agent` or `chain` can have sub-steps with children. A workflow with a retriver and an LLM step would look like this:

```json
{
  "type": "workflow",
  "input": "What is the capital of France?",
  "output": "Paris",
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "retriever",
      "input": "What is the capital of France?",
      "output": [{ "content": "Paris is the capital and largest city of France." }]
    },
    {
      "type": "llm",
      "input": "What is the capital of France?",
      "output": "Paris"
    }
  ]
}
```
