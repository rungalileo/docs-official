Galileo supports fine-grained control over granting users different levels of access to the system, as well as organizing users into groups for easily sharing projects.

## System-level Roles

There are 4 roles that a user can be assigned:

**Admin** – Full access to the organization, including viewing all projects.

**Manager** – Can add and remove users.

**User** – Can create, update, share, and delete projects and resources within projects.

**Read-only** – Cannot create, update, share, or delete any projects or resources. Limited to view-only permissions.

In chart form:

|                                       | Admin                             | Manager                                        | User                                      | Read-only                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

| View projects                         | <Icon icon="square-check"/> (all) | <Icon icon="square-check"/> (only shared)      | <Icon icon="square-check"/> (only shared) | <Icon icon="square-check"/> (only shared) |

System-level roles are chosen when users are invited to Galileo:

## Groups

Users can be organized into groups to streamline sharing projects.

There are 3 types of groups:

**Public** – Group and members are visible to everyone in the organization. Anyone can join.

**Private** – Group is visible to everyone in the organization. Members are kept private. Access is granted by a group maintainer.

**Hidden** – Group and its members are hidden from non-members in the organization. Access is granted by a group maintainer.

Within a group, each member has a group role:

**Maintainer** – Can add and remove members.

**Member** – Can view other members and shared projects.

## Sharing Projects

By default, only a project's creator (and managers and admins) have access to a project. Projects can be shared both with individual users and entire groups. Together, these are called _collaborators._ Collaborators can be added when you create a project:

Or anytime afterwards:
