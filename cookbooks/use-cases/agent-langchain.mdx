title: Monitoring LangChain Agents with Galileo
description: Learn how to build and monitor a LangChain AI Agent using Galileo for tracing and observability.
---

## Overview

### What you'll build:

A simple LangChain-powered AI Agent that uses OpenAI's language models and a custom tool, with all agent activities logged and monitored in Galileo.

### What you'll learn:

- How to configure a LangChain Agent
- How to integrate Galileo for observability and monitoring
- How to structure tools and environment for scalable development

### Requirements

- Python package manager + some familiarity with Python (for the sake of this cookbook, we'll use [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
- A free [Galileo Developer Account](https://app.galileo.ai)
- OpenAI Key to assist [get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

## Environment Setup

**Ingredients:**

- git
- Python environment tools
- Package manager (pip or uv)

**Steps:**


1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rungalileo/sdk-examples.git
   cd sdk-examples/python/agent/langchain-agent
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   **on Windows**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   **on Mac**
   Using a standard virtual environment

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Or using uv (faster)

   ```bash
   uv venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
  Using pip

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   OR using uv

   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your environment variables:**
Copy the existing `.env.example` file, and rename it to `.env` in your project directory. 

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
GALILEO_API_KEY=your-galileo-api-key
```

- Replace `your-openai-api-key` and `your-galileo-api-key` with your actual keys.
- This keeps your credentials secure and out of your code.
## Understanding the Agent Architecture

### üß† Agent Core (`main.py`)

A single script defines:

- Loading of secrets
- Tool declaration
- Agent instantiation
- Galileo observability

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools

Simple `@tool` functions that the agent can call, such as:

```python
@tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Say hello to someone."""
    return f"Hello, {name}! üëã"
```

### üîç Instrumentation (`galileo_context` + `GalileoCallback`)

The `galileo_context` tags all logs under a project and stream.

The `GalileoCallback` automatically traces agent behavior in Galileo.

## Main Agent Workflow

**Key Ingredients:**

- LangChain agent
- OpenAI model
- Galileo integration

**How it works:**

1. Load `.env` variables.
2. Declare tools.
3. Wrap agent execution in `galileo_context`.
4. Use `GalileoCallback` to trace the run.
5. Print the agent's response.

## Running the Agent

Run your script using:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Expected Output:

```
Agent Response:
Hello, Erin! üëã
```

## Viewing Traces in Galileo

### Steps:

1. Log into [Galileo](https://app.galileo.ai).
2. Open the `langchain-docs` project and `my_log_stream`.
3. Inspect:

   - Prompts
   - Reasoning steps
   - Tool invocations
   - Outputs

## Extending the Agent

### Add New Tools

Define more `@tool`-decorated functions and include them in the agent.

### Change Models

Swap out `gpt-4` for another supported OpenAI model in `ChatOpenAI`.

### Update Context

Change the `project` and `log_stream` in `galileo_context` for better trace organization.

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways:

- LangChain + Galileo makes AI agents traceable and observable
- Using tools and context managers helps modularize and organize agent behavior
- Monitoring enables better debugging and optimization

### Next Steps:
- Check out the [Galileo YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rungalileo) to see what you can build!
- Star the [Galileo SDK-examples repo](https://github.com/rungalileo/sdk-examples)to bookmark more ways to get started with the Galileo SDK.

Happy building! üöÄ

## Common Issues and Solutions

### API Key Issues

**Problem:** "Invalid API key" errors

**Solution:**
- Double-check your `.env` file

### Galileo Connection Issues

**Problem:** Traces aren't showing up in Galileo

**Solution:**
- Confirm your API key is valid
- Check internet connectivity
- Ensure `flush()` is being called at the end of execution
