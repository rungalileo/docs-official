title: Create User Dataset Collaborators
openapi: post /datasets/{dataset_id}/users
---

This endpoint allows you to share a dataset with specific users by adding them as collaborators. You can specify the role for each user to control their level of access to the dataset.

### Roles

- **owner**: Full control over the dataset, including deletion and sharing
- **editor**: Can view and modify the dataset content
- **annotator**: Can view the dataset and add annotations
- **viewer**: Can only view the dataset content

## Response

The response is an array of user collaborator objects:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `id` | string (UUID) | Unique identifier for the collaborator relationship |
| `user_id` | string (UUID) | Unique identifier of the user |
| `role` | string | Assigned role for the user |
| `first_name` | string or null | First name of the user |
| `last_name` | string or null | Last name of the user |
| `email` | string | Email address of the user |
| `created_at` | string (date-time) | When the collaborator was added |
| `permissions` | array of objects | Permissions associated with this collaborator |

## Notes

- You must have share permission for the dataset to add collaborators
- Users will receive notifications about being added as collaborators
- Adding a user with the "owner" role transfers ownership of the dataset
- If a user is already a collaborator, their role will be updated
- If the dataset doesn't exist or the user doesn't have permission to share it, a 404 error will be returned
