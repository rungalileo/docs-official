title: Update Group Dataset Collaborator
openapi: patch /datasets/{dataset_id}/groups/{group_id}
---

This endpoint allows you to update the role of a group that has access to a dataset. This is useful for changing a group's level of access, such as promoting a viewer group to an editor group or demoting an editor group to a viewer group.

### Roles

- **owner**: Full control over the dataset, including deletion and sharing
- **editor**: Can view and modify the dataset content
- **annotator**: Can view the dataset and add annotations
- **viewer**: Can only view the dataset content

## Response

The response returns the updated group collaborator object:

| Field         | Type               | Description                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | string (UUID)      | Unique identifier for the collaborator relationship |
| `group_id`    | string (UUID)      | Unique identifier of the group                      |
| `group_name`  | string             | Name of the group                                   |
| `role`        | string             | Updated role for the group                          |
| `created_at`  | string (date-time) | When the collaborator was added                     |
| `permissions` | array of objects   | Permissions associated with this collaborator       |

## Notes

- You must have share permission for the dataset to update group collaborator roles
- Changing a group's role affects all members of that group
- Changing a group's role to "owner" transfers ownership of the dataset to that group
- If the dataset or group doesn't exist, or you don't have permission to update collaborators, a 404 error will be returned
- Group members will receive notifications about changes to their access level
