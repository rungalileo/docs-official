title: Preview Dataset

## Notes

- This endpoint is useful for testing column mappings before applying them permanently
- The preview does not modify the actual dataset
- Use pagination parameters to efficiently preview large datasets
- The column_names array provides the names of columns in the same order as the values in each row
- If the dataset doesn't exist or the user doesn't have permission to access it, a 404 error will be returned
