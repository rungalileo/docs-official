## Notes

- This operation is irreversible - once a dataset is deleted, it cannot be recovered
- You must have delete permission for the dataset to perform this operation
- If the dataset is being used by any projects, you may need to remove those dependencies first
- If the dataset doesn't exist or the user doesn't have permission to delete it, a 404 error will be returned
