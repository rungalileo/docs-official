title: Update User Dataset Collaborator
openapi: patch /datasets/{dataset_id}/users/{user_id}
---

This endpoint allows you to update the role of a user who has access to a dataset. This is useful for changing a user's level of access, such as promoting a viewer to an editor or demoting an editor to a viewer.

### Roles

- **owner**: Full control over the dataset, including deletion and sharing
- **editor**: Can view and modify the dataset content
- **annotator**: Can view the dataset and add annotations
- **viewer**: Can only view the dataset content

## Response

The response returns the updated user collaborator object:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `id` | string (UUID) | Unique identifier for the collaborator relationship |
| `user_id` | string (UUID) | Unique identifier of the user |
| `role` | string | Updated role for the user |
| `first_name` | string or null | First name of the user |
| `last_name` | string or null | Last name of the user |
| `email` | string | Email address of the user |
| `created_at` | string (date-time) | When the collaborator was added |
| `permissions` | array of objects | Permissions associated with this collaborator |

## Notes

- You must have share permission for the dataset to update collaborator roles
- Changing a user's role to "owner" transfers ownership of the dataset to that user
- You cannot change your own role if you are the owner (you must transfer ownership first)
- Users will receive notifications about changes to their access level
- If the dataset or user doesn't exist, or you don't have permission to update collaborators, a 404 error will be returned
