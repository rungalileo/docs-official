title: Delete Group Dataset Collaborator
openapi: delete /datasets/{dataset_id}/groups/{group_id}
---

This endpoint allows you to remove a group's access to a dataset. Once removed, members of the group will no longer be able to view or interact with the dataset unless they have access through another means (such as individual access or through another group).

## Response

A successful deletion returns an empty JSON object.

## Notes

- You must have share permission for the dataset to remove group collaborators
- Removing a group's access affects all members of that group who don't have access through other means
- You cannot remove a group if it is the owner of the dataset (you must transfer ownership first)
- Group members will receive notifications about being removed from the dataset
- If the dataset or group doesn't exist, or you don't have permission to manage collaborators, a 404 error will be returned
- This operation cannot be undone - to restore access, you must add the group as a collaborator again
