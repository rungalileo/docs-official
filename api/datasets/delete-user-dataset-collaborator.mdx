title: Delete User Dataset Collaborator
openapi: delete /datasets/{dataset_id}/users/{user_id}
---

This endpoint allows you to remove a user's access to a dataset. Once removed, the user will no longer be able to view or interact with the dataset unless they are granted access again.

## Response

A successful deletion returns an empty JSON object.

## Notes

- You must have share permission for the dataset to remove collaborators
- You cannot remove yourself if you are the owner of the dataset (you must transfer ownership first)
- Users will receive notifications about being removed from the dataset
- If the dataset or user doesn't exist, or you don't have permission to manage collaborators, a 404 error will be returned
- This operation cannot be undone - to restore access, you must add the user as a collaborator again
