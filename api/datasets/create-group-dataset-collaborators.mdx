title: Create Group Dataset Collaborators
openapi: post /datasets/{dataset_id}/groups
---

This endpoint allows you to share a dataset with specific groups by adding them as collaborators. You can specify the role for each group to control the level of access that group members will have to the dataset.

### Roles

- **owner**: Full control over the dataset, including deletion and sharing
- **editor**: Can view and modify the dataset content
- **annotator**: Can view the dataset and add annotations
- **viewer**: Can only view the dataset content

## Response

The response is an array of group collaborator objects:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `id` | string (UUID) | Unique identifier for the collaborator relationship |
| `group_id` | string (UUID) | Unique identifier of the group |
| `group_name` | string | Name of the group |
| `role` | string | Assigned role for the group |
| `created_at` | string (date-time) | When the collaborator was added |
| `permissions` | array of objects | Permissions associated with this collaborator |

## Notes

- You must have share permission for the dataset to add group collaborators
- All members of the group will receive access to the dataset according to the assigned role
- If a group is already a collaborator, its role will be updated
- If the dataset doesn't exist or the user doesn't have permission to share it, a 404 error will be returned
- Users will be notified about being granted access to the dataset through their group membership
