## Notes

- You must have at least viewer access to the dataset to list its collaborators
- The list includes yourself if you are a collaborator on the dataset
- Use pagination parameters to efficiently retrieve large lists of collaborators
- If the dataset doesn't exist or the user doesn't have permission to access it, a 404 error will be returned
