title: Download Dataset
openapi: get /datasets/{dataset_id}/download
---

This endpoint allows you to download the entire dataset as a file. The dataset will be returned in its original format (CSV, Feather, or JSONL).

## Response

The response is a file download containing the dataset in its original format. The Content-Type header will indicate the format of the file.

## Notes

- This endpoint returns the raw dataset file, not a JSON response
- For large datasets, the download may take some time to complete
- The file will be in the same format as it was originally uploaded (CSV, Feather, or JSONL)
- If the dataset doesn't exist or the user doesn't have permission to access it, a 404 error will be returned
- If you need to access only a portion of the dataset or apply filters, consider using the Get Dataset Content or Query Dataset Content endpoints instead
