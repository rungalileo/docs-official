title: Query Dataset Versions
openapi: post /datasets/{dataset_id}/versions/query

This endpoint allows you to retrieve the version history of a dataset. Each modification to a dataset creates a new version, and this endpoint helps you track those changes over time.

| `next_starting_token` | integer or null | Token to use for the next page of results, or null if no more results |

### Version Object

## Notes

- Version history is useful for tracking changes and rolling back to previous states if needed
- The version_index can be used with the Rollback Dataset Content endpoint to revert to a specific version
- To view the actual content of a specific version, use the Get Dataset Version Content endpoint
- If the dataset doesn't exist or the user doesn't have permission to access it, a 404 error will be returned
