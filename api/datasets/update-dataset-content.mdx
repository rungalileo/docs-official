title: Update Dataset Content
openapi: patch /datasets/{dataset_id}/content
---

This endpoint allows you to modify the content of a dataset by applying a series of edits. You can add, update, or delete rows and columns in a single request.

## Headers

| Header     | Type   | Description                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `If-Match` | string | ETag of the dataset as a version identifier. Optional. Example: "d89cce33-549d-4b6d-b220-afb641d859c8" |

## Response

A successful update returns an empty JSON object.

## Notes

- All edits in a single request are applied as a single transaction
- If any edit fails, the entire transaction is rolled back
- Each edit creates a new version of the dataset
- Using the If-Match header helps prevent conflicts when multiple users are editing the dataset
- You must have update permission for the dataset to perform this operation
- If the dataset doesn't exist or the user doesn't have permission to update it, a 404 error will be returned
