## Notes

- You must have at least viewer access to the dataset to list its group collaborators
- Use pagination parameters to efficiently retrieve large lists of group collaborators
- If the dataset doesn't exist or the user doesn't have permission to access it, a 404 error will be returned
- This endpoint only shows groups that have direct access to the dataset, not individual users
