title: Get Dataset Content
openapi: get /datasets/{dataset_id}/content
---

This endpoint retrieves the actual content (rows and values) of a dataset. The results are paginated to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Response

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `starting_token` | integer | The starting token used for this request |
| `limit` | integer | The limit used for this request |
| `paginated` | boolean | Whether the results are paginated |
| `next_starting_token` | integer or null | Token to use for the next page of results, or null if no more results |
| `column_names` | array of strings | Names of columns in the dataset |
| `rows` | array of objects | List of dataset row objects |

## Notes

- Use pagination parameters to efficiently retrieve large datasets
- The column_names array provides the names of columns in the same order as the values in each row
- For more complex filtering or querying of dataset content, use the Query Dataset Content endpoint
- If the dataset doesn't exist or the user doesn't have permission to access it, a 404 error will be returned
