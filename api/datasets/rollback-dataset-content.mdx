title: Rollback Dataset Content
openapi: put /datasets/{dataset_id}/content
---

This endpoint allows you to revert a dataset's content to a previous version. This is useful for undoing changes or recovering from errors in dataset modifications.

## Response

A successful rollback returns an empty JSON object.

## Notes

- This operation creates a new version of the dataset with the content from the specified previous version
- The rollback itself is recorded as a new version in the dataset's history
- You must have update permission for the dataset to perform this operation
- To find available version numbers, use the Query Dataset Versions endpoint
- If the specified version doesn't exist or the user doesn't have permission to update the dataset, a 404 error will be returned
- This operation cannot be undone, but you can rollback to a more recent version if needed
