title: Update Scorer
openapi: patch /scorers/{scorer_id}
---

This endpoint allows you to update the metadata and default settings of an existing scorer in your Galileo account. You can modify attributes such as the name, description, tags, and default configuration parameters. Note that this endpoint updates the scorer itself, not its versions; scorer versions are immutable once created.

### Example Request

```json
{
  "name": "Enhanced Customer Support Quality Evaluator",
  "description": "Updated evaluator for customer support responses with improved criteria",
  "tags": ["customer-support", "quality", "production", "enhanced"],
  "defaults": {
    "model_name": "gpt-4-turbo",
    "num_judges": 5,
    "filters": [
      {
        "field": "response_type",
        "value": "customer_support"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Notes

- You can update multiple attributes in a single request
- Only the fields included in the request will be updated; omitted fields will remain unchanged
- This endpoint updates the scorer's metadata and defaults, but does not affect existing versions
- To create a new version of a scorer, use the appropriate endpoint based on the scorer type (Create LLM Scorer Version or Create Code Scorer Version)
- Consider updating tags to reflect changes in the scorer's purpose or status
- Updating the defaults only affects future evaluations; it does not retroactively change previous evaluations
