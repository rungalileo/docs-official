openapi: post /scorers/{scorer_id}/version/code
---

Code scorers allow you to evaluate and score your AI model outputs using custom code. This endpoint enables you to upload a new version of your code scorer by providing a file containing your implementation. Code scorers are useful for implementing custom evaluation metrics or complex scoring logic that isn't available through standard metrics.

## Security

This endpoint requires authentication. You can authenticate using:

- An API key in the `Galileo-API-Key` header
- OAuth2 password flow
- HTTP Basic authentication

## Notes

- The file should contain a valid implementation according to the scorer requirements
- Each upload creates a new version of the scorer
- Previous versions remain accessible but the latest version will be used by default
