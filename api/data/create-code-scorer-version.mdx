Code scorers allow you to evaluate and score your AI model outputs using custom code. This endpoint enables you to upload a new version of your code scorer by providing a file containing your implementation. Code scorers are useful for implementing custom evaluation metrics or complex scoring logic that isn't available through standard metrics.
