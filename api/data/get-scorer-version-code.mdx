title: Get Scorer Version Code
openapi: get /scorers/{scorer_id}/version/code
---

This endpoint retrieves the code implementation for a specific version of a code-based scorer. Code-based scorers allow you to implement custom evaluation logic using Python code, and this endpoint provides access to the actual code that defines how the scorer evaluates responses.

## Response

The response contains the Python code implementation of the scorer version.

### Example Response

```json
{
  "scorer_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "code": "def evaluate(response, context):\n    # Check if the response contains required information\n    required_elements = ['pricing', 'features', 'support']\n    score = 1.0\n    \n    for element in required_elements:\n        if element not in response.lower():\n            score -= 0.2\n    \n    # Check for factual accuracy\n    if 'premium plan costs $49.99' not in response:\n        score -= 0.3\n    \n    return {\n        'completeness_score': max(0, score),\n        'has_required_elements': score > 0.5\n    }",
  "created_at": "2023-04-15T09:30:00Z",
  "created_by": "user_12345"
}
```

## Error Responses

| Status Code | Description                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `404`       | Scorer or version not found                   |
| `403`       | Insufficient permissions to access the scorer |
| `400`       | Invalid query parameters                      |

## Notes

- This endpoint is specifically for code-based scorers; it will return an error if used with other scorer types
- The code returned is the actual Python implementation that runs when the scorer is used for evaluation
- You can use this endpoint to review, audit, or debug your custom scoring logic
- The code must follow the Galileo scorer format, with an `evaluate` function that takes `response` and `context` parameters
- The returned code can be used as a reference for creating new versions or similar scorers
