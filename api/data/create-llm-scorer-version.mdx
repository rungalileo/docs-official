LLM scorers leverage language models to evaluate and score AI outputs based on custom criteria. This endpoint allows you to create a new version of an LLM scorer by providing instructions and a template for how the evaluation should be performed. LLM scorers are particularly useful for subjective evaluations like tone, creativity, or adherence to complex requirements that are difficult to measure programmatically.
