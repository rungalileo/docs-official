## Notes

- Prompt groups help organize and categorize your prompts for easier management and analysis
- Use the `project_id` parameter to filter groups specific to a particular project
- Use the `run_id` parameter to see groups that were used in a specific experiment run
- The `include_stats` parameter provides additional usage metrics that can be helpful for performance analysis
- Groups can be used to compare performance across different prompt strategies or use cases
- For accounts with many prompt groups, use pagination to manage response size and loading times
