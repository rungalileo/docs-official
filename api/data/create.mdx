---

Scorers are evaluation tools that help you assess the quality and performance of your AI model outputs. This endpoint allows you to create a new scorer that can be used to evaluate responses based on specific criteria. Galileo supports different types of scorers, including LLM-based scorers for subjective evaluations, code-based scorers for custom metrics, and preset scorers for common evaluation needs.

| `defaults` | object | Optional default settings for the scorer |
| `scorer_type` | string | Type of scorer to create: "llm", "code", or "preset" |

### defaults Object

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `model_name` | string | Optional default model to use for LLM scorers |

## Security

This endpoint requires authentication. You can authenticate using:

- An API key in the `Galileo-API-Key` header
- OAuth2 password flow
- HTTP Basic authentication

## Notes

- After creating a scorer, you'll need to create a version for it using the appropriate endpoint based on the scorer type
- LLM scorers are best for subjective evaluations like tone, creativity, or adherence to complex requirements
- Code scorers are ideal for implementing custom metrics or complex scoring logic
- Preset scorers provide ready-to-use evaluations for common metrics
