The [Galileo Python SDK](https://github.com/rungalileo/galileo-python/tree/main) ([latest release](https://github.com/rungalileo/galileo-python/releases/latest)) allows you to log all prompts, responses, and statistics around your LLM usage. There are three main ways to log your application:

1. **[Using a wrapper (Recommended)](#wrapper-method)** - Instead of importing common LLMs like `openai`, use Galileo's wrapper which automatically logs everything, no other code changes required!
2. **[Using a decorator](#decorator-method)** - By decorating a function that calls an LLM with the `@log` decorator, the Galileo SDK logs all AI prompts within.
3. **[Directly using the `GalileoLogger` class (Manual)](#manual-method)** - As a last resort, you can directly use the base class, but this requires calling multiple methods per LLM call.

Regardless of how you go about logging your AI application, you will still need to initialize your API keys and install the Galileo SDK by following the steps below.

## Installation

Install Galileo's Python SDK to your project by running:
```bash
pip install galileo
```

## Initialization/Authentication

Create or update a `.env` file with the following values:

```env
# Scoped to an Organization
GALILEO_API_KEY=...

# Optional, set a default Project
GALILEO_PROJECT=...
# Optional, set a default Log Stream
GALILEO_LOG_STREAM=...
```

## Logging

### Using LLM Wrappers

The simplest way to get started is to use our OpenAI client wrapper. This example will automatically produce a single-span trace in the Logstream UI:

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetSdkOpenAIBasic />
</CodeGroup>

<a id="decorator-method"></a>
### Using the `@log` Decorator

The `@log` decorator is used to capture the inputs and outputs of a function as a span. By default, a workflow span is created when span_type isn't specified. Here are the different span types:

- **Workflow**: A span that can have child spans, useful for nesting several child spans to denote a thread within a trace. If you add the `@log` decorator to a parent method, calls that are made within that scope are automatically logged in the same trace.
- **LLM**: Captures the input, output, and settings of an LLM call. This span gets automatically created when our OpenAI client library wrapper is used. Cannot have nested children.
- **Retriever**: Contains the output documents of a retrieval operation.
- **Tool**: Captures the input and output of a tool call. Used to decorate functions that are invoked as tools.

This example will create a trace with a workflow span and two nested LLM spans:

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetSdkWorkflow />
</CodeGroup>

Here's how to create a retriever span using the decorator:

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetSdkRetriever />
</CodeGroup>

Here's how to create a tool span using the decorator:

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetSdkTool />
</CodeGroup>

For more detailed information and examples, see the [@log Decorator documentation](./logging/log-decorator).

### Pure invocation using the `GalileoLogger`
This is the most verbose way to log your application. It requires manually calling the `GalileoLogger` class and adding spans to the trace. We recommend using the other two methods whenever possible.

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetSdkGalileoLogger />
</CodeGroup>

### Grouping and Uploading Logs Faster: `galileo_context()`

Regardless of the method you use to add logs, the Galileo context manager can be useful for a few things:
- Automatically starting a trace and ensuring anything that happens in its scope is logged as a span within the trace.
- For long running app runtimes like Streamlit, the request never terminates. You can use the context manager to start a trace and ensure that traces are flushed when the manager exits.
- You might want to route a part of your app to a different Project or Log Stream. You can use the context manager to set the trace scope.

Using the context manager to create a trace with a nested LLM span (which is automatically flushed when the manager exits):

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetSdkContextBasic />
</CodeGroup>

In some cases (like long-running processes), it may be necessary to explicitly flush the trace to upload it to Galileo:

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetSdkContextExplicitFlush />
</CodeGroup>
