Experiments in Galileo allow you to evaluate and compare different prompts, models, and configurations using datasets. This helps you identify the best approach for your specific use case.


## Running Experiments with Prompt Templates

The simplest way to get started is by using a prompt template:

<Note>
  Hint: The `get_dataset` function expects a dataset that you created through either the [console](https://app.galileo.ai/datasets) or the [SDK](./datasets#creating-datasets). 
  Ensure you have saved a dataset before running the experiment!
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetExperimentsPrompt />
</CodeGroup>

## Running Experiments with Custom Functions

For more complex scenarios, you can use custom functions with the OpenAI wrapper. 

<Note>
  Hint: Here, you may use either a [saved dataset](./datasets#creating-datasets) or a [custom one](#custom-dataset-evaluation)

## Custom Dataset Evaluation

When you need to test specific scenarios:

  <SnippetExperimentsCustomDataset />
</CodeGroup>

## Custom Metrics for Deep Analysis

For sophisticated evaluation needs:

  <SnippetExperimentsCustomMetrics />
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

1. **Use consistent datasets**: Use the same dataset when comparing different prompts or models to ensure fair comparisons.

2. **Test multiple variations**: Run experiments with different prompt variations to find the best approach.

3. **Use appropriate metrics**: Choose metrics that are relevant to your specific use case.

4. **Start small**: Begin with a small dataset to quickly iterate and refine your approach before scaling up.

5. **Document your experiments**: Keep track of what you're testing and why to make it easier to interpret results.
