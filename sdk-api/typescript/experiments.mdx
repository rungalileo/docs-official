Galileo Experiments allow you to evaluate and improve your LLM applications by running tests against datasets and measuring performance using various metrics.


## Running an Experiment with a Prompt Template

The simplest way to get started is by using a prompt template: 

<Note>
  Hint: `datasetName` expects a dataset that you created through either the [console](https://app.galileo.ai/datasets) or the [SDK](./datasets#creating-and-using-datasets). 
  Ensure you have saved a dataset before running the experiment!
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetPromptTemplate />
</CodeGroup>

## Running an Experiment with a Runner Function

For more complex scenarios, you can use a runner function:

<Note>
  Hint: You may use either a [saved dataset](./datasets#creating-and-using-datasets) or a [custom one](#running-an-experiment-with-a-custom-dataset).
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetRunnerFunction />
</CodeGroup>

## Running an Experiment with a Custom Dataset

When you need to test specific scenarios:

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetCustomDataset />
</CodeGroup>

## Running an Experiment with Custom Metrics

For sophisticated evaluation needs:

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetCustomMetrics />
