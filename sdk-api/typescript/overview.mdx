title: Overview
---

The Galileo TypeScript SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools for logging, evaluating, and experimenting with LLM applications. It's designed to be easy to use while providing powerful features for monitoring and improving your AI applications.

> Note: This library is in pre-release mode and may not be stable.

## Installation

```bash
npm install galileo
# or
yarn add galileo
```

## Key Features

- **Logging**: Capture LLM interactions, tool usage, and workflow execution
- **Experimentation**: Run experiments to evaluate and improve your LLM applications
- **Datasets**: Create and manage datasets for testing and evaluation
- **Prompts**: Create, version, and test prompt templates

## Getting Started

The simplest way to get started is to use our OpenAI client wrapper:

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { wrapOpenAI, flush, init } from "galileo";

// Initialize Galileo
init({
  projectName: "my-project",
  logStreamName: "development"
});

const openai = wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY }));

await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [{ content: "Say hello world!", role: "user" }],
});

// Flush logs before exiting
await flush();
```

## Authentication

Make sure you have a Galileo API key and configure Galileo using environment variables:

```.env
# Scoped to an Organization
GALILEO_API_KEY=...

# Optional, set a default Project
GALILEO_PROJECT=...

# Optional, set a default Log Stream
GALILEO_LOG_STREAM=...
```

## SDK Components

The Galileo TypeScript SDK consists of several components:

- **Wrappers**: Easily integrate with popular LLM providers like OpenAI
- **Core Logging**: Log LLM interactions, tool usage, and workflow execution
- **Experiments**: Run experiments to evaluate and improve your LLM applications
- **Datasets**: Create and manage datasets for testing and evaluation
- **Prompts**: Create, version, and test prompt templates
