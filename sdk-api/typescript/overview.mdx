The [Galileo TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/rungalileo/galileo-js) ([latest release](https://github.com/rungalileo/galileo-js/releases/latest)) provides a comprehensive set of tools for logging, evaluating, and experimenting with LLM applications. It's designed to be easy to use while providing powerful features for monitoring and improving your AI applications.

<InfoNote>Visit the [Galileo NPM package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/galileo) for more installation options and version information.</InfoNote>

## Key Features

- **Logging**: Capture LLM interactions, tool usage, and workflow execution
- **Experimentation**: Run experiments to evaluate and improve your LLM applications
- **Datasets**: Create and manage datasets for testing and evaluation
- **Prompts**: Create, version, and test prompt templates

## Installation

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetInstallationNpm />
  <SnippetInstallationYarn />
  <SnippetInstallationPnpm />
</CodeGroup>

## Initialization and Authentication

Make sure you have a Galileo API key and configure Galileo using environment variables:

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetEnvSetup />
</CodeGroup>

<Note>The SDK automatically targets the [production console](https://app.galileo.ai). If you are using a deployment of Galileo on premises or in the cloud, point `GALILEO_CONSOLE_URL` to your own installation.</Note>

## Getting Started

The simplest way to get started is to use our OpenAI client wrapper:

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetOpenAIBasic />
</CodeGroup>

## Logging Methods

The TypeScript SDK allows you to log all prompts, responses, and statistics around your LLM usage. There are three main ways to log your application:

1. **[Using a wrapper (Recommended)](/sdk-api/typescript/wrappers/wrappers-overview)** - Instead of importing LLM clients directly like `openai`, use Galileo's wrapper which automatically logs everything with no other code changes required!
2. **[Using the log function wrapper](/sdk-api/typescript/logging/log-function-wrapper)** - By wrapping a function that calls an LLM with the `log` function wrapper, you can create workflow spans with nested LLM calls and tool spans.
3. **[Directly using the `GalileoLogger` class (Manual)](/sdk-api/typescript/logging/galileo-logger)** - For more advanced use cases, you can use the GalileoLogger directly to have full control over the logging process.

Regardless of which logging method you choose, you will need to initialize your API keys and install the Galileo SDK by following the steps below.

## Additional Documentation

The Galileo TypeScript SDK consists of several components: Check out the individual component documentation for more details.

- [**Wrappers**](/sdk-api/typescript/wrappers/wrappers-overview): Easily integrate with popular LLM providers like OpenAI
- [**Core Logging**](/sdk-api/typescript/logging/galileo-logger): Log LLM interactions, tool usage, and workflow execution
- [**Experiments**](/sdk-api/typescript/experiments): Run experiments to evaluate and improve your LLM applications
- [**Datasets**](/sdk-api/typescript/datasets): Create and manage datasets for testing and evaluation
- [**Prompts**](/sdk-api/typescript/prompts): Create, version, and test prompt templates
