The `log` function wrapper allows you to wrap functions with spans of different types. It serves two main purposes:

1. It tells our logger to wrap the function contents as a span (you can specify the type in the first argument - by default a workflow span is created).
2. If there is no current trace when you execute a function wrapped in `log`, it will create a single span trace.

## Usage

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetLogWrapperBasic />
</CodeGroup>

## Span Types

The `log` function wrapper supports different span types:

- **workflow**: A span that can have child spans, useful for nesting several child spans to denote a thread within a trace. If you wrap a parent function with `log`, calls that are made within that scope are automatically logged in the same trace.
- **llm**: Captures the input, output, and settings of an LLM call. This span gets automatically created when our client library wrappers (OpenAI and Anthropic) are used. Cannot have nested children.
- **retriever**: Contains the output documents of a retrieval operation.
- **tool**: Captures the input and output of a tool call. Used to decorate functions that are invoked as tools.

## Examples

### Workflow Span with Nested LLM Calls

Create a trace with a workflow span and nested LLM spans:

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetLogWrapperExample />
</CodeGroup>

### Retriever Span

Log a retriever function. If the output of the function is an array, it will automatically capture it as documents in the span:

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetLogWrapperRetriever />
</CodeGroup>
