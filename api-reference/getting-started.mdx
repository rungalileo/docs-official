title: API Reference | Getting Started with Galileo
---

Galileo provides a public REST API that you can use to interact with the Galileo platform. This API allows you to perform various operations across Evaluate, Observe and Protect. This guide will help you get started with the Galileo REST API.

## Base API URL

The first thing you need to talk to the Galileo API is the base URL of your Galileo API instance.

If you know the URL that you use to access the Galileo console, you can replace `console` in it with `api`. For example, if your Galileo console URL is `https://console.galileo.myenterprise.com`, then your base URL for the API is `https://api.galileo.myenterprise.com`.

### Verify the Base URL

To verify the base URL of your Galileo API instance, you can send a `GET` request to the [`healthcheck` endpoint](/api-reference/health/healthcheck).

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.galileo.myenterprise.com/v1/healthcheck
```

## Authentication

For interacting with our public endpoints, you can use any of the following methods to authenticate your requests:

### API Key

To use your [API key](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-evaluate/quickstart#getting-an-api-key) to authenticate your requests, include the key in the HTTP headers for your requests.

```json
{ "Galileo-API-Key": "<my-api-key>" }
```

### HTTP Basic Auth

To use HTTP Basic Auth to authenticate your requests, include your username and password in the HTTP headers for your requests.

```json
{ "Authorization": "Basic <base64encode(<my-galileo-username>:<my-galileo-password>)>" }
```

### JWT Token

To use a JWT token to authenticate your requests, include the token in the HTTP headers for your requests.

```json
{ "Authorization": "Bearer <my-jwt-token>" }
```

We recommend using this method for high-volume requests because it is more secure (expires after 24 hours) and scalable than using an API key.

To generate a JWT token, send a `GET` request to the [`get-token` endpoint](/api-reference/auth/get-token) using the API Key or HTTP Basic auth.
