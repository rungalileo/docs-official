**Spans** in Galileo are the fundamental building blocks of traces, representing discrete operations or units of work within your AI application. A span captures a single step in your application's workflow, such as an LLM call, a document retrieval operation, a tool execution, or any other distinct process.

Each span records detailed information about a specific operation, including its inputs, outputs, duration, and any relevant metadata. Spans are organized hierarchically within traces, allowing you to understand both individual operations and their relationships to each other.

### The Role of Spans in Representing Units of Work

Spans serve several critical roles in the Galileo platform:

1. **Granular Representation**: Spans break down complex workflows into discrete, manageable units, making it easier to understand and analyze each step.

2. **Contextual Information**: Each span contains rich contextual information about the operation it represents, including inputs, outputs, and configuration details.

3. **Hierarchical Organization**: Spans can be nested within other spans, creating a hierarchical structure that reflects the organization of your application's workflows.

4. **Performance Tracking**: Spans capture timing information, allowing you to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.

5. **Error Isolation**: When issues occur, spans help isolate the specific operation where the error originated.

### How Spans Contribute to System Evaluation and Debugging

Spans are essential for detailed system evaluation and debugging for several reasons:

1. **Pinpoint Precision**: Spans allow you to pinpoint exactly where in a workflow issues are occurring, rather than just knowing that something went wrong.

2. **Input-Output Analysis**: By examining the inputs and outputs of each span, you can identify where unexpected results are being generated.

3. **Performance Profiling**: Span durations help you identify which operations are taking the most time, guiding optimization efforts.

4. **Error Context**: When errors occur, spans provide the context needed to understand what led to the error and how to fix it.

5. **Quality Assessment**: Spans enable evaluation of individual components of your system, helping you identify which parts are performing well and which need improvement.

## Key Components of a Span

A span in Galileo consists of several core components:

### Essential Components

1. **Input**: The data or query provided to the operation
2. **Output**: The response or result generated by the operation
3. **Span Type**: The type of operation (e.g., llm, workflow, retriever, tool)
4. **Duration**: The time taken to complete the operation
5. **Timestamp**: When the operation occurred
6. **Parent Span**: The span that contains this span (if applicable)
7. **Child Spans**: Spans contained within this span (if applicable)

### Span Types and Their Behavior

Galileo supports several types of spans, each designed to capture different kinds of operations:

1. **LLM Spans**: Capture interactions with language models, including:
   - Prompts sent to the model
   - Responses received from the model
   - Model configuration (e.g., model name, temperature)
   - Token usage and other performance metrics

2. **Workflow Spans**: Represent logical groupings of operations that can contain child spans, useful for:
   - Organizing complex processes
   - Creating hierarchical structures
   - Grouping related operations

3. **Retriever Spans**: Record document retrieval operations, including:
   - Search queries
   - Retrieved documents
   - Relevance scores
   - Retrieval configuration

4. **Tool Spans**: Document tool calls in agent-based systems, including:
   - Tool inputs
   - Tool outputs
   - Error information (if applicable)
   - Tool configuration

Each span type has specific fields and behaviors tailored to the operation it represents, allowing for more detailed and relevant information capture.

### The Role of Metadata in Spans

Metadata enhances the traceability and utility of spans in several ways:

1. **Contextual Information**: Metadata provides additional context about the operation, such as user IDs, session information, or application-specific data.

2. **Filtering and Searching**: Metadata can be used to filter and search for specific spans, making it easier to find relevant information.

3. **Correlation**: Metadata helps correlate spans across different traces or systems, enabling end-to-end visibility.

4. **Custom Attributes**: You can add custom attributes to metadata to capture information specific to your application or use case.

5. **Debugging Context**: In debugging scenarios, metadata can provide crucial context about the state of your application when the operation occurred.

## Creating and Managing Spans

Galileo provides several methods for creating and managing spans, each offering different levels of control and convenience.

### Required Inputs and Configurations

When creating spans, you need to provide:

- **Input**: The data being processed by the operation
- **Output** (for concluded spans): The result of the operation
- **Span Type**: The type of operation (llm, workflow, retriever, or tool)
- **Name** (for workflow and tool spans): A descriptive name for the operation

Additional optional configurations include:

- **Metadata**: Additional contextual information
- **Tags**: Labels for categorization
- **Parent Span**: The span that contains this span (if applicable)
- **Model Configuration** (for LLM spans): Details about the model used

### Customization Options

Spans can be customized in several ways:

- **Custom Metadata**: Add application-specific metadata to provide additional context
- **Custom Tags**: Add tags to categorize spans and make them easier to filter
- **Nested Spans**: Create hierarchical structures by nesting spans within other spans
- **Error Handling**: Capture and log errors for better debugging
- **Custom Span Types**: Define custom span types for application-specific operations

## Using Spans in Practice

### Common Use Cases

Spans in Galileo are valuable for a wide range of use cases:

1. **LLM Interaction Tracking**: Capture details of interactions with language models, including prompts, responses, and model configurations.

2. **RAG Pipeline Analysis**: Track each step in a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, from document retrieval to LLM generation.

3. **Agent Workflow Monitoring**: Monitor the actions of AI agents, including tool calls and decision-making processes.

4. **Performance Profiling**: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities by analyzing span durations.

5. **Error Diagnosis**: When issues occur, examine spans to understand what went wrong and why.

6. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate the quality of individual components in your AI system.

### Representing Different Parts of a Workflow

Spans can represent various parts of a workflow:

- **LLM Spans**: Represent interactions with language models
- **Retriever Spans**: Represent document retrieval operations
- **Tool Spans**: Represent tool calls or external API interactions
- **Workflow Spans**: Represent logical groupings of operations or multi-step processes

By combining these span types, you can create a complete representation of your application's workflows, from simple LLM calls to complex multi-step processes.

### Best Practices

When working with spans, follow these best practices:

1. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive names for spans to make them easier to understand and analyze.

2. **Appropriate Granularity**: Create spans at an appropriate level of granularity - too fine-grained and you'll have too many spans to manage, too coarse-grained and you'll miss important details.

3. **Include Relevant Metadata**: Add metadata that will be useful for filtering, analysis, and debugging.

4. **Proper Hierarchy**: Organize spans in a logical hierarchy that reflects the structure of your application's workflows.

5. **Error Handling**: Log errors in spans to help with debugging and analysis.

6. **Complete Spans**: Always conclude spans to ensure they have both input and output information.

7. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for similar spans across your application.

## Integration with the Galileo Ecosystem

### Integration with Other Components

Spans integrate seamlessly with other Galileo components:

1. **Logs**: Spans contain log data, providing structure and context for individual log entries.

2. **Traces**: Spans are organized into traces, which represent complete interactions or workflows.
