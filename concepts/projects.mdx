description: Organizational Units in Galileo

**Projects** in Galileo are top-level organizational units that serve as containers for your AI application resources. They help you organize related [log streams](/concepts/logstreams), [experiments](/concepts/experiments), and other resources in one place.

## Key Functions

Projects provide organization by grouping related resources together, access control to manage who can view or modify your data, collaboration capabilities for sharing with team members, and isolation to keep unrelated applications separate.

## What's in a Project?

A project contains [log streams](/concepts/logstreams), [spans](/concepts/spans), and [traces](/concepts/traces)), [experiments](/concepts/experiments) for comparing different models or configurations, [metrics](/concepts/metrics) that measure your application's performance, and datasets derived from logs for fine-tuning or evaluation.

## User Management

Projects can be shared with team members using different access levels. Viewers can only view resources, editors can view and modify resources, and admins have full control including user management capabilities.

## Creating a Project

Creating a project is straightforward: navigate to the Galileo dashboard, click "Create Project," enter a name and description, and click "Create."

## Best Practices

For effective project management, use clear descriptive names, create separate projects for different environments (development, staging, production), and regularly review user access to maintain security.

## Next Steps

After creating a project, you can create [log streams](/concepts/logstreams), set up [metrics](/concepts/metrics), and create [experiments](/concepts/experiments) to start monitoring and evaluating your AI applications.
