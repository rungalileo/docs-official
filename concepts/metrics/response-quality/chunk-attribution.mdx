**Chunk Attribution** measures whether or not each chunk retrieved in a RAG pipeline had an effect on the model's response.

## How it Works

Chunk Attribution is a binary metric: each chunk is either <Pill label="Attributed" /> or <Pill label="Not Attributed" />.

A chunk is considered "Attributed" when:
- The model incorporated information from the chunk into its response
- The chunk influenced the model's reasoning or conclusions
- The chunk provided context that shaped the response in some way

Chunks that are retrieved but have no discernible impact on the model's output are marked as "Not Attributed."

<Callout type="info">
  Chunk Attribution is closely related to [Chunk Utilization](/concepts/metrics/retrieval/chunk-utilization): Attribution measures whether or not a chunk affected the response, while Utilization measures how much of the chunk text was involved in the effect. Only chunks that were Attributed can have Utilization scores greater than zero.
</Callout>

## Optimizing Your RAG Pipeline

When analyzing Chunk Attribution in your RAG system, consider these key optimization strategies:

### Tuning the Number of Retrieved Chunks

If your system produces satisfactory responses but many chunks are <Pill label="Not Attributed" />, you can likely reduce the number of chunks retrieved per example without impacting response quality.

This approach offers several benefits:
- Lower costs by processing fewer chunks
- Reduced latency and improved response time
- More efficient system resource utilization

### Debugging Anomalous Model Behavior

When a specific model response is unsatisfactory or unusual, Attribution helps you identify exactly which chunks influenced that response.

This debugging approach provides:
- Faster root cause analysis for problematic responses
- More targeted fixes based on specific influential chunks
- Better understanding of model reasoning and information utilization

    Track the percentage of chunks that are attributed over time to identify trends and potential issues in your retrieval system.

<Note>
When optimizing for Chunk Attribution, be careful not to reduce the number of chunks too aggressively, as this may limit the model's access to potentially useful information in edge cases.
