<DefinitionCard>
  <strong>Chunk Attribution</strong> measures whether or not each chunk retrieved in a RAG pipeline had an effect on the model's response.
</DefinitionCard>

Chunk Attribution is a binary metric: each chunk is either <Pill label="Attributed" /> or <Pill label="Not Attributed" />.

A chunk is considered <Pill label="Attributed" /> when:

- The model incorporated information from the chunk into its response
- The chunk influenced the model's reasoning or conclusions
- The chunk provided context that shaped the response in some way

Chunks that are retrieved but have no discernible impact on the model's output are marked as <Pill label="Not Attributed" />.

<Callout type="info">
  Chunk Attribution is closely related to [Chunk Utilization](chunk-utilization): Attribution measures whether or not a chunk affected the response, while Utilization measures how much of the chunk text
  was involved in the effect. Only chunks that were Attributed can have Utilization scores greater than zero.

## Understanding Attribution

  </div>

Consider this simple example that illustrates chunk attribution:

<div style={{ marginTop: "1rem", paddingTop: "0.75rem", borderTop: "1px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.33)" }}>
  <strong>User query:</strong> "What are the health benefits of green tea?"
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: "0.75rem", paddingTop: "0.75rem", borderTop: "1px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.33)" }}>
  <strong>Retrieved chunks:</strong>
  <ul style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem" }}>
    <li>Chunk 1: "Green tea contains antioxidants that may reduce the risk of heart disease."</li>
    <li>Chunk 2: "Black tea is produced by oxidizing tea leaves after they are harvested."</li>
    <li>Chunk 3: "Studies suggest green tea may help with weight loss and metabolism."</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: "0.75rem", paddingTop: "0.75rem", borderTop: "1px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.33)" }}>
  <strong>Model response:</strong> "Green tea offers several health benefits, including antioxidants that may reduce heart disease risk and potential effects on weight loss and metabolism."
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: "1rem", paddingTop: "0.75rem", borderTop: "1px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.33)" }}>
  <strong>Attribution analysis:</strong> Chunks 1 and 3 would be <Pill label="Attributed" /> because information from them appears in the response. Chunk 2 would be <Pill label="Not Attributed" /> because it contains information about black
  tea, which wasn't included in the response.
</div>

## Optimizing Your RAG Pipeline

  </div>

When analyzing Chunk Attribution in your RAG system, consider these key optimization strategies:

<div style={{ marginTop: "1rem", paddingTop: "0.75rem", borderTop: "1px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.33)" }}>
  <strong>Tune retrieved chunk count:</strong> If many chunks are <Pill label="Not Attributed" />, reduce the number of chunks retrieved to improve efficiency without impacting quality.
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: "0.75rem", paddingTop: "0.75rem", borderTop: "1px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.33)" }}>
  <strong>Debug problematic responses:</strong> When responses are unsatisfactory, examine which chunks were attributed to identify the source of issues.
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: "0.75rem", paddingTop: "0.75rem", borderTop: "1px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.33)" }}>
  <strong>Improve retrieval quality:</strong> Use attribution data to refine your retrieval algorithms and embedding models.

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Monitor Attribution Rates" icon="chart-line">
    Track the percentage of chunks that are attributed over time to identify trends and potential issues in your retrieval system.

</Card>
  <Card title="Balance with Other Metrics" icon="scale-balanced">
    Use Chunk Attribution alongside [Chunk Relevance](chunk-relevance) and [Chunk Utilization](chunk-utilization) for a complete picture of retrieval effectiveness.

</Card>
  <Card title="Optimize Chunk Size" icon="crop">
    Experiment with different chunk sizes to find the optimal balance between attribution rates and information density.

</Card>
  <Card title="Improve Retrieval Quality" icon="filter">
    Use attribution data to refine your retrieval algorithms and embedding models.

</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
When optimizing for Chunk Attribution, be careful not to reduce the number of chunks too aggressively, as this may limit the model's access to potentially useful information in edge cases.
