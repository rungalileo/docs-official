title: Correctness
description: Evaluate factual accuracy in AI outputs using Galileo Guardrail Metrics to detect and prevent hallucinations in your AI systems.

**Correctness** measures whether a given model response contains factually accurate information.

## How it Works

Correctness is a continuous metric ranging from 0 to 1:
- A value of 1 (or close to 1) indicates high correctness - the information is believed to be factually accurate
- A value of 0 (or close to 0) indicates low correctness - the response likely contains factual errors

This metric is particularly valuable for uncovering open-domain hallucinations: factual errors that don't relate to any specific documents or context provided to the model.

## Calculation Method

Correctness is computed through a multi-step process:
- Sending additional requests to OpenAI's GPT4-o
- Using a carefully engineered chain-of-thought prompt that asks the model to judge whether the response is factually accurate
- Requesting multiple distinct responses to this prompt
- Each evaluation produces an explanation along with a final judgment: yes or no
- The final score is the fraction of "yes" responses divided by the total number of responses

We also surface one of the generated explanations, always choosing one that aligns with the majority judgment among the responses:
- If the score is greater than 0.5, the explanation will provide an argument that the response is factual
- If the score is less than 0.5, the explanation will provide an argument that it is not factual

<Note>
This metric is computed by prompting an LLM multiple times, and thus requires additional LLM calls to compute, which may impact usage and billing.

## How Correctness Differs from Context Adherence

It's important to understand the distinction between related metrics:
- **Correctness** measures whether a model response has factually correct information, regardless of whether that information is contained in the provided context
- **Context Adherence** measures whether the response adheres specifically to the information provided in the context

For example, in a text-to-SQL scenario:
- A response could be factually correct (high Correctness) but not derived from the provided context (low Context Adherence)
- Conversely, a response could faithfully represent the context (high Context Adherence) but contain factual errors if the context itself is incorrect

## Optimizing Your AI System

### Addressing Low Correctness Scores

When a response has a low Correctness score, it's likely that the response contains non-factual information. To improve your system:

1. **Flag and examine potentially non-factual responses**: Identify patterns in responses that tend to contain factual errors
2. **Adjust your prompts**: Instruct the model to stick to information it's given in the context and avoid speculation
3. **Implement verification steps**: Add additional checks for factual accuracy before responses reach end users
4. **Consider model selection**: Some models may be more factually accurate than others for specific domains

<Note>
When optimizing for Correctness, remember that even human experts can disagree on certain facts. Consider implementing confidence levels for responses, especially in domains with evolving knowledge or subjective elements.
