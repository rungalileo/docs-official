<DefinitionCard>
  <strong>Sexism Detection</strong> flags whether a response contains sexist content. Output is a binary classification of whether a response is sexist or not.
</DefinitionCard>

### Calculation Method

Sexism detection is computed through a specialized process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Model Architecture">
    The detection system is built on a Small Language Model (SLM) that combines training from both open-source datasets and carefully curated internal datasets to identify various forms of sexist content.

</Step>
  <Step title="Performance Validation">
    The model demonstrates robust detection capabilities with an 83% accuracy rate when tested against the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism dataset, a widely recognized benchmark for sexism detection.

When sexist content is detected in your system, consider these approaches:

<div style={{ marginTop: "1rem", paddingTop: "0.75rem", borderTop: "1px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.33)" }}>
  <strong>Implement guardrails:</strong> Flag responses before being served to prevent future occurrences.
</div>

<div style={{ marginTop: "0.75rem", paddingTop: "0.75rem", borderTop: "1px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.33)" }}>
  <strong>Fine-tune models:</strong> Adjust model behavior to reduce sexist outputs.
</div>

<Note>
Identify responses that contain sexist comments and take preventive measures to ensure fair and unbiased AI interactions.
