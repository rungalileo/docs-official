**Action Advancement** measures whether an assistant successfully accomplishes or makes progress toward at least one user goal in a conversation.

## How it Works

An assistant successfully advances a user's goal when it:

1. Provides a complete or partial answer to the user's question
2. Requests clarification or additional information to better understand the user's needs
3. Confirms that a requested action has been successfully completed

For an interaction to count as advancing the user's goal, the assistant's response must be:
- Factually accurate
- Directly addressing the user's request
- Consistent with any tool outputs used

## Scoring

If the Action Advancement score is less than 100%, it means at least one evaluator determined the assistant failed to make progress on any user goal.

Action Advancement is calculated by:

1. Sending multiple evaluation requests to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT4o-mini)
2. Using a specialized chain-of-thought prompt that follows the definition above
3. Each evaluation produces an explanation and a binary judgment (yes/no)
4. The final score is the percentage of "yes" responses out of all responses

We display one of the generated explanations alongside the score, always choosing one that aligns with the majority judgment.

<Note>
This metric requires multiple LLM calls to compute, which may impact usage and billing.

## When to Use This Metric

Action Advancement is particularly valuable for evaluating:

- **Agentic Workflows**: When an AI agent must decide on actions and select appropriate tools
- **Multi-step Tasks**: When completing a user's request requires multiple steps or decisions
- **Tool-using Assistants**: When evaluating if the assistant used available tools effectively

This metric helps you determine whether the assistant chose appropriate actions and made meaningful progress toward fulfilling the user's request.
