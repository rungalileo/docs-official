Follow this step-by-step guide to get started using **Annotations** in your AI projects.

### Prerequisites

First, follow the [Getting Started with Galileo](/getting-started/quickstart) guide if you don't already have a Galileo Project set up.

Then, use the following steps to add annotations to your Project.

### Step 1: Open Your Galileo App

Open your Galileo application in your code editor.

In this guide, we are using the **finished demo application** from the [Getting Started](/getting-started/quickstart) guide.

Each code snippet in the following steps will be added to the end of the [Getting Started](/getting-started/quickstart) demo code.

  <SnippetAnnotationsWalkthroughPython1 />
  <SnippetAnnotationsWalkthroughTypeScript1 />
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Define Tags and Metadata

Create **descriptive tags and metadata** to be attached to your logs. Both [Spans](/concepts/logging/spans) and [Traces](/concepts/logging/traces) can have their own tags and metadata.

Define `tags` as a list of relevant labels, and `metadata` as a dictionary of label types and their values. The individual tag and metadata values must be strings.

- **NOTE** : The `answer` variable is set to the raw text output of the model so that it can be used later.

### Step 3: Initialize Galileo Logger

Initialize logging by importing and calling the **Galileo Logger**.

The **Project name** and **Log Stream name** are used as inputs to define in which Galileo Project and log stream the logs will be created.

After running our application, the logs will appear in the chosen Project's log stream in the [Galileo Console](https://app.galileo.ai/).

</CodeGroup>

### Step 4: Initialize New Trace

Initialize a new [Trace](/concepts/logging/traces) to start listening for data to log.

By using the `tags` and `metadata` inputs, our annotations are attached to the Trace.

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetAnnotationsWalkthroughPython4 />
  <SnippetAnnotationsWalkthroughTypeScript4 />
</CodeGroup>

### Step 5: Create New Span

Create a new [Span](/concepts/logging/spans) containing the data created by running the LLM.

By using the `tags` and `metadata` inputs, our annotations are attached to the Span.

**NOTE** : In this guide, the tags and metadata used for the Span and the Trace are identical. But, they don't have to be. You can use different tags and metadata for Spans and the Traces they're attached to.

  <SnippetAnnotationsWalkthroughTypeScript5 />
</CodeGroup>

### Step 6: Close Trace & Push Logs

To close the new Trace and **complete the logging session**, we use `logger.conclude()` with the LLM's raw text output as the input.

Then, `logger.flush()` pushes the logs to the selected Project's [Log Stream](/concepts/logging/logstreams).

### Step 7: Review Your Code

By adding each previous code snippet to your Galileo application, it is ready to run and create annotated logs.

Below is the **final combined application code** for the [Getting Started](/getting-started/quickstart) demo application, with our annotated log functionality added to it.

</CodeGroup>

### Step 8: Run Your Application

Run your Galileo application.

If your application file is named `app` (as in the [Getting Started](/getting-started/quickstart) demo), you can run it by using the following command in your terminal.

<CodeGroup>
  <SnippetAnnotationsWalkthroughPython8 />
  <SnippetAnnotationsWalkthroughTypeScript8 />
</CodeGroup>

### Step 9: Open Project in Galileo Console

In the [Galileo Console](https://app.galileo.ai/), select your Project and Log Stream in the top-left corner.

For **each time you run your application**, you will see a new Trace entry in your Log Stream.

Each metadata key-value pair is displayed in its own column, which can be used for sorting and filtering.

### Step 10: View Trace Annotations

Click on an entry in the list.

You will see the data logged to the Trace. This includes:

- The raw text input (because we initialized the Trace with `input=prompt`)
- The raw text output from the LLM (because we closed the Trace with `logger.conclude(answer)`)
- The tags and metadata we created (found in the **Parameters** section in the top-right)

### Step 11: View Span Annotations

With the Trace open, click the `llm` button below `Trace` in the data map on the left.

You will see the data logged to the Span. This includes:

- The complete JSON LLM input (because we created the Span with `input=[{"role": "system", "content": prompt}]`)
- The complete JSON LLM output (because we created the Span with `output=response.choices[0].message.content`)
- The tags and metadata we created (found in the **Parameters** section in the top-right)

## Next Steps:

Continue testing, customizing, and incorporating tags and metadata into your AI project development process and implementation.

Use **Annotations** to:

- Keep your [experimentation](/concepts/experiments/overview) process organized.
- Coordinate with your team and track development.
- Track individual steps in your AI project with [Traces](/concepts/logging/traces) containing multiple [Spans](/concepts/logging/spans) that each have their own distinct annotations.
- Use the tag and metadata values in your code to automate alerts and improvements.
