title: Log Streams
---

Log Streams in Galileo are organizational units that group related logs together based on logical deployments, applications, or environments. They provide a structured way to categorize and manage logs across your AI workflows, making it easier to monitor, analyze, and debug specific segments of your application ecosystem.

Log Streams serve as containers for logs, allowing you to:

- Separate logs from different environments (development, staging, production)
- Isolate logs from different applications or services
- Group logs by feature, team, or business unit
- Organize logs for specific experiments or testing scenarios

### Why Log Streams Are Important

Log Streams play a crucial role in organizing your logging infrastructure for several reasons:

1. **Organization**: Log Streams provide a clean separation between different parts of your application ecosystem, preventing logs from becoming mixed and difficult to analyze.

2. **Environment Isolation**: They allow you to keep logs from development, staging, and production environments separate, making it easier to focus on relevant data.

3. **Lifecycle Management**: Different Log Streams can have different retention policies, allowing you to keep critical production logs longer while purging development logs more frequently.

### How Log Streams Support Workflows

Log Streams contribute to effective log management in several ways:

- **Debugging**: When issues arise, you can focus on logs from the specific environment or application where the problem occurred, reducing noise and speeding up troubleshooting.

- **Monitoring**: Log Streams enable targeted monitoring of specific applications or environments, making it easier to set up relevant alerts and dashboards.

- **Analysis**: By organizing logs into logical groups, Log Streams facilitate more focused analysis and pattern recognition within specific contexts.

## Key Components of a LogStream

A LogStream in Galileo consists of several core components:

1. **Name**: A unique identifier for the LogStream within a project
2. **Description**: Optional information about the purpose or content of the LogStream
3. **Tags**: Labels for additional categorization and filtering
4. **Metadata**: Additional contextual information about the LogStream
5. **Access Controls**: Permissions determining who can view or modify the LogStream

### How Logs Are Grouped in Log Streams

Logs are grouped into Log Streams based on how you configure your logging setup:

- **Explicit Assignment**: When creating logs, you can explicitly specify which LogStream they should be sent to.
- **Default Assignment**: If no LogStream is specified, logs may be sent to a default LogStream.
- **Pattern-Based Routing**: In some configurations, logs can be routed to different Log Streams based on patterns or rules.

Within a LogStream, logs are typically organized chronologically, but can be filtered and sorted based on various attributes such as:

- Timestamp
- Log type
- Severity or importance
- Source application or component
- User or session information
- Custom tags or metadata

### Role of Metadata in Log Streams

Metadata plays an important role in organizing and filtering Log Streams:

- **Stream-Level Metadata**: Provides context about the LogStream itself, such as its purpose, owner, or associated application.
- **Log-Level Metadata**: Enriches individual logs with additional context that can be used for filtering and analysis.

Common metadata used with Log Streams includes:

- Environment information (dev, staging, prod)
- Application or service name
- Version information
- Deployment identifiers
- Team or owner information
- Geographic or regional data

## Creating and Managing Log Streams

### How to Create Log Streams

Log Streams can be created through various methods in Galileo:

#### Using the Galileo UI

The simplest way to create a LogStream is through the Galileo web interface:

1. Navigate to your project in the Galileo console
2. Go to the Log Streams section
3. Click "Create LogStream"
4. Provide a name and optional description
5. Configure any additional settings
6. Save the new LogStream

#### Using the Galileo SDK

You can also create Log Streams programmatically using the Galileo SDK:

<CodeGroup>
```python create_logstream.py
from galileo import GalileoLogger

# Initialize with a new log stream (will be created if it doesn't exist)

logger = GalileoLogger(project="my-project", log_stream="new-log-stream")

````

```typescript create_logstream.ts
import { withGalileo } from "galileo";

// The log stream will be created if it doesn't exist
withGalileo({ project: "my-project", logStream: "new-log-stream" }, async () => {
  // Your code here
});
````

</CodeGroup>
#### Using Environment Variables

You can set a default LogStream using environment variables:

```env
GALILEO_PROJECT=my-project
GALILEO_LOG_STREAM=my-log-stream
```

### Required Configurations

At minimum, a LogStream requires:

- **Name**: A unique identifier within the project
- **Project**: The Galileo project the LogStream belongs to

Additional optional configurations include:

- **Description**: Information about the purpose or content of the LogStream
- **Tags**: Labels for categorization
- **Metadata**: Additional contextual information
- **Retention Policy**: How long logs should be kept in the LogStream

### Customization Options

Log Streams can be customized in several ways:

- **Naming Conventions**: Establish consistent naming patterns for different types of Log Streams
- **Tagging**: Add tags to categorize Log Streams and make them easier to filter
- **Metadata**: Include additional context such as environment, application, or team information
- **Access Controls**: Configure who can view or modify the LogStream
- **Retention Policies**: Set how long logs should be kept in the LogStream

## Using Log Streams in Practice

### Organizing Logs for Different Environments

A common pattern is to create separate Log Streams for different environments:

- **Development LogStream**: Captures logs from local development environments, typically with verbose logging enabled
- **Staging LogStream**: Contains logs from the staging or QA environment, used for pre-production testing
- **Production LogStream**: Holds logs from the live production environment, often with more selective logging

This separation allows you to:

- Apply different retention policies to each environment
- Set up environment-specific monitoring and alerts
- Focus on relevant logs when debugging issues
- Prevent development logs from cluttering production analysis

### Best Practices

When managing Log Streams, follow these best practices:

#### Naming Conventions

- Use consistent, descriptive names
- Include the environment in the name (e.g., `app-name-prod`, `app-name-dev`)
- Consider including version information for major releases

#### Organization Strategies

- Create separate Log Streams for different applications or services
- Use distinct Log Streams for different environments
- Consider creating special-purpose Log Streams for experiments or debugging

#### Maintenance

- Regularly review and clean up unused Log Streams
- Document the purpose and ownership of each LogStream
- Establish clear retention policies based on importance and compliance requirements

### Isolating Workflows and Failure Modes

Log Streams can be used to isolate specific workflows or failure modes:

- **Feature-Specific Log Streams**: Create dedicated Log Streams for new or experimental features
- **Error Log Streams**: Route error logs to a dedicated stream for easier monitoring
- **Critical Path Log Streams**: Isolate logs from critical business workflows for heightened monitoring

This isolation helps you:

- Focus on specific areas when debugging
- Set up targeted alerts for critical components
- Analyze patterns in specific workflows without noise from unrelated logs

## Integration with the Galileo Ecosystem

### Interaction with Other Components

Log Streams integrate with other Galileo components in several ways:

1. **Logs**: Log Streams are the organizational containers for logs, providing structure and context.

2. **Traces**: Traces are typically kept within a single LogStream, maintaining the context of related operations.

3. **Projects**: Log Streams exist within projects, which provide the top-level organization in Galileo.

4. **Metrics**: Metrics can be calculated and displayed per LogStream, allowing for comparative analysis.

5. **Alerts**: Alerts can be configured to monitor specific Log Streams for anomalies or issues.

### Supporting Workflows

Log Streams support various workflows in Galileo:

- **Evaluation**: Compare performance across different Log Streams to evaluate changes or experiments
- **Debugging**: Isolate issues by focusing on relevant Log Streams
- **Experimentation**: Use separate Log Streams for control and experimental groups
- **Monitoring**: Set up dashboards and alerts for specific Log Streams

### Dependencies and Connections

Log Streams have dependencies on several Galileo components:

- **Projects**: All Log Streams belong to a specific project
- **API Keys**: Authentication is required to create and access Log Streams
- **SDK**: The Galileo SDK is used to interact with Log Streams
- **Logs**: Log Streams contain and organize logs

## Examples and Practical Applications

### Basic LogStream Creation

Here's a simple example of creating and using a LogStream with the Galileo SDK:

<CodeGroup>
```python create_logstream.py
from galileo import GalileoLogger
from galileo.openai import openai

# Initialize with a specific log stream

logger = GalileoLogger(project="my-project", log_stream="production-app")

# Any logs created will go to the specified log stream

response = openai.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4o",
messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about AI"}]
)

````

```typescript create_logstream.ts
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { withGalileo } from "galileo";
import { wrapOpenAI } from "galileo/wrappers";

const openai = wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI({ apiKey: "" }));

// Use a specific log stream for this block of code
withGalileo({ project: "my-project", logStream: "production-app" }, async () => {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Tell me about AI" }],
  });
  return response.choices[0].message.content;
});
````

</CodeGroup>
### Multi-Environment LogStream Management

Here's an example of managing logs across different environments:

```python
import os
from galileo import GalileoLogger
from galileo.openai import openai

# Determine environment from environment variable
env = os.getenv("APP_ENVIRONMENT", "development")

# Create a logger with an environment-specific log stream
logger = GalileoLogger(
    project="my-ai-app",
    log_stream=f"my-ai-app-{env}"
)

# All logs will now go to the environment-specific stream
```

### Custom Tagging for Log Streams

You can use tags and metadata to further organize logs within a LogStream:

<CodeGroup>
```python custom_tagging.py
from galileo import GalileoLogger, galileo_context

# Initialize the base logger

logger = GalileoLogger(project="my-project", log_stream="production")

# Use context to add tags for a specific feature

with galileo_context(tags=["recommendation-engine", "v2.3"]): # All logs in this context will have the specified tags # making them easier to filter within the log stream
result = recommendation_engine.get_recommendations(user_id)

````

```typescript custom_tagging.ts
import { withGalileo } from "galileo";

// Use context to add tags for a specific feature
withGalileo({ project: "my-project", logStream: "production" }, async () => {
    // All logs in this context will have the specified tags
    // making them easier to filter within the log stream
    result = recommendation_engine.get_recommendations(user_id)
});
````

</CodeGroup>
