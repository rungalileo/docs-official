Once you have run some experiments, the next natural step is to compare the results of your experiments, allowing you to optimize prompts, select the best model for your use case, or tune your input data to suit your needs.

Galileo allows you to compare up to five different experiments, showing the difference in outputs, metrics, latency, and token usage.

## Prerequisites

To compare experiments, you will need:

- A project containing two or more experiments, created either from the [Galileo console](concepts/experiments/running-experiments-in-console), or in [code](concepts/experiments/running-experiments) 

## Compare experiments

Experiments can be compared from the Experiments tab in the [Galileo console](https://app.galileo.ai/). Experiments are part of a project, so select the relevant project to see the experiments tab.

1. Open the **Experiments** tab

1. Select the experiments you want to compare by checking the box next to each experiment. Select between two and five experiments.

1. Select the **Compare experiments** button to open the comparison page

1. You will see the experiments side by side in the comparison page

### Review the comparison

The comparison shows each experiment's metrics, inputs, and outputs. 

1. If your experiment has multiple inputs, you can navigate between inputs using the forward and backwards buttons. Your experiment inputs should align by position - for example if you have two inputs in each, the comparison is based on input one from experiment one being compared to input one from experiment two, and so on.

    > All the experiments in the comparison should have the same number of inputs. If they do not, you will only be able to navigate based off of the experiment with the least inputs.

1. The **Details** section shows the model used, and averages and totals for both the cost of each response and generating the metrics, as well as averages for the metrics.

    > Averages are calculated for experiments with multiple inputs.

1. The **Metrics** section shows the metrics for the currently selected input. These metrics include system metrics (latency, the number of input and output tokens), and the selected metrics for the experiment.

    If you hover over a metric, a pop-up will explain the reasoning behind the score, along with details of the LLM used to judge, the cost of the judgment, and the number of judges used.

1. The **Input** and **Output** sections show the input to the experiment, and the output generated by the LLM.
