The OpenAI Agents Python SDK provides a framework for building multi-agent workflows. Galileo provides a GalileoTracingProcessor, allowing you to send detailed trace information to Galileo for monitoring, analysis, and debugging.


## Installation

Ensure you have both the openai-agents library and the Galileo SDK installed:

`pip install galileo openai-agents`

## Authentication and project setup

First create an [API key](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-evaluate/quickstart#getting-an-api-key) to authenticate.
Copy your project name and log stream name and set the environment variables.

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetAgents1Python />
</CodeGroup>


## Python setup: Adding the Galileo processor

The integration is two lines of code adding the GalileoTracingProcessor to the list of trace processors used by the openai-agents SDK.

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetAgents2Python />
</CodeGroup>


## Example Usage
Here's a complete example demonstrating how to set up agents and run them with Galileo tracing enabled:

<CodeGroup>
<SnippetAgents3Python />
</CodeGroup>

## Summary

1. Set the environment variables with the API key, project name and log stream name.
2. Initialize and set the Galileo processor.
3. Start logging with Galileo.


## FAQ

### How do I setup a project?

Log into your console and create a new logging project. Copy the project name and log stream name after setup

### Can I use this alongside other trace processors?
Yes. The `set_trace_processors` function accepts a list, so you can include GalileoTracingProcessor alongside other processors if needed: `set_trace_processors([GalileoTracingProcessor(), OtherProcessor()])`.
