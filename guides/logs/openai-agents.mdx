---

The OpenAI Agents Python SDK provides a framework for building multi-agent workflows. Galileo provides a GalileoTracingProcessor, allowing you to send detailed trace information to Galileo for monitoring, analysis, and debugging.


## Installation

Ensure you have both the openai-agents library and the Galileo SDK installed:

`pip install galileo openai-agents`

## Authentication and project setup

First create an [API key](/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-evaluate/quickstart#getting-an-api-key) to authenticate.
Copy your project name and log stream name and set the environment variables.

```python
import os

# Replace with your actual Galileo credentials
os.environ["GALILEO_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_GALILEO_API_KEY"
os.environ["GALILEO_PROJECT"] = "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME"
os.environ["GALILEO_LOG_STREAM"] = "YOUR_LOG_STREAM_NAME" # Often used per run/experiment

# Also ensure your OpenAI API key is set for the agents to function
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```


## Python setup: Adding the Galileo processor

The integration is two lines of code adding the GalileoTracingProcessor to the list of trace processors used by the openai-agents SDK.

```python
from agents import set_trace_processors
from galileo.handlers.openai_agents import GalileoTracingProcessor
# Ensure environment variables for Galileo and OpenAI are set as shown above

# Initialize and register the Galileo Tracing Processor

set_trace_processors([GalileoTracingProcessor()])
```

## Example Usage
Here's a complete example demonstrating how to set up agents and run them with Galileo tracing enabled:

```python
import os
import asyncio
from agents import (
    Agent,
    GuardrailFunctionOutput,
    InputGuardrail,
    InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered,
    Runner,
    set_trace_processors
)
from pydantic import BaseModel
from galileo.handlers.openai_agents import GalileoTracingProcessor

# --- 1. Configure Credentials (Replace with your actual keys/names) ---
os.environ["GALILEO_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_GALILEO_API_KEY"
os.environ["GALILEO_PROJECT"] = "MyAgentProject"
os.environ["GALILEO_LOG_STREAM"] = "TutorAgentRun_1"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# --- 2. Setup Galileo Tracing ---
set_trace_processors([GalileoTracingProcessor()])

# --- 3. Define Agents and Logic ---
class HomeworkOutput(BaseModel):
    is_homework: bool
    reasoning: str

guardrail_agent = Agent(
    name="Guardrail check", instructions="Check if the user is asking about homework.", output_type=HomeworkOutput
)

math_tutor_agent = Agent(
    name="Math Tutor",
    handoff_description="Specialist agent for math questions",
    instructions="You provide help with math problems. Explain your reasoning.",
)

history_tutor_agent = Agent(
    name="History Tutor",
    handoff_description="Specialist agent for historical questions",
    instructions="You provide assistance with historical queries.",
)

async def homework_guardrail(ctx, agent, input_data):
    print("Running homework guardrail...")
    result = await Runner.run(guardrail_agent, input_data, context=ctx.context)
    final_output = result.final_output_as(HomeworkOutput)
    # Tripwire triggers if it *is* homework (we want to block homework)
    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(output_info=final_output, tripwire_triggered=final_output.is_homework)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="Determine which specialist agent (Math or History) to use based on the user's question. If it's not clearly Math or History, say you cannot help.",
    handoffs=[history_tutor_agent, math_tutor_agent],
    input_guardrails=[InputGuardrail(guardrail_function=homework_guardrail)],
)

# --- 4. Run the Agent Workflow ---
async def main():
    print("Running agent for a history question...")
    result_history = await Runner.run(triage_agent, "Who was the first president of the United States?")
    print("\n--- History Result ---")
    print(result_history.final_output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # In Jupyter/Colab, use nest_asyncio or run directly if event loop exists
    # import nest_asyncio
    # nest_asyncio.apply()
    # asyncio.run(main())
    # Or if running in a script:
    asyncio.run(main())
```
## Summary

1. Set the environment variables with the API key, project name and log stream name.
2. Initialize and set the Galileo processor.
3. Start logging with Galileo.


## FAQ

### How do I setup a project?

Log into your console and create a new logging project. Copy the project name and log stream name after setup

### Can I use this alongside other trace processors?
Yes. The `set_trace_processors` function accepts a list, so you can include GalileoTracingProcessor alongside other processors if needed: `set_trace_processors([GalileoTracingProcessor(), OtherProcessor()])`.
