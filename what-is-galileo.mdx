Galileo is a comprehensive AI evaluation and monitoring platform designed specifically to address the unique challenges of building and maintaining Generative AI applications powered by non-deterministic Large Language Models (LLMs).

## The Challenge of Non-Deterministic AI

Traditional testing and monitoring tools fall short when applied to modern AI applications. When non-determinism is introduced into a system through LLMs, developers can no longer rely on deterministic tests to understand if their application is working as intended. This creates significant challenges in ensuring quality, reliability, and safety in AI applications.

Key challenges include:
- **Unpredictable outputs** that vary even with identical inputs
- **Difficult quality assessment** without clear right or wrong answers
- **Complex debugging** when issues arise in production
- **Evolving model behavior** as underlying LLMs are updated

## How Galileo Helps

Galileo provides a structured framework that empowers development teams to iterate rapidly and deploy confidently as they build sophisticated AI experiences. With Galileo, teams can assess output quality under ever-changing inputs and model states using automatic metrics, while comparing and tracking the impact of code changes, prompt tweaks, and model updates on user-facing results.

The platform enables automated regression detection despite non-deterministic outputs through configurable tolerance thresholds, and seamlessly incorporates user feedback into continuous improvement cycles to ensure updates align with real-world needs. Throughout this process, Galileo offers clear visibility into system behavior over time, enabling data-driven decisions for prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and overall system design.

Galileo's core value propositions:
- **Data-driven confidence** in your AI application's performance
- **Rapid iteration cycles** with immediate quality feedback
- **Proactive issue detection** before users are impacted
- **Continuous improvement** based on real-world usage patterns

## Capabilities

Galileo's integrated platform works throughout the entire AI application lifecycle, offering a seamless experience from development to production. During development, you can test and optimize prompts with comprehensive quality metrics, run controlled experiments to compare different approaches, and create custom evaluation criteria tailored to your specific use case.

As you move to production, Galileo continues to provide value by tracking performance, costs, and latency in real-time environments. The platform visualizes complete traces of your AI application execution, helping you identify and diagnose issues across complex AI workflows. Additionally, Galileo helps safeguard your applications by detecting harmful content, protecting sensitive information, and implementing custom moderation rules.

Essential capabilities include:
- **End-to-end evaluation** from prompt design to production monitoring
- **Comprehensive visibility** into your AI application's behavior
- **Actionable insights** that guide specific improvements
- **Safety guardrails** that protect users and your business
