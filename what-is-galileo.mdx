Galileo is an AI evaluation and monitoring platform built specifically for developers working with non-deterministic LLMs. It addresses the inherent challenges of generative AI—where the same input can yield different outputs—making it hard to pin down quality and troubleshoot issues.

## The Challenge

Generative AI introduces a unique set of challenges that traditional testing methods _simply cannot address_.

In this space, even when you feed the exact same input into your system, you might receive a range of different outputs, complicating the process of defining what **“correct” even means**. This variability makes it difficult to establish consistent benchmarks and increases the complexity of debugging when something goes awry.

Moreover, as the underlying models and data are updated and evolve, application behavior can shift unexpectedly, rendering previously successful tests obsolete. This dynamic environment requires tools that not only measure performance accurately but also adapt to ongoing changes, all while providing clear, actionable insights into the AI’s behavior across its entire lifecycle.

## How Galileo Helps

- **Data-Driven Metrics:** Automated, token-level quality checks to reveal nuanced performance insights.
- **Configurable Regression Detection:** Tolerance thresholds that filter out minor fluctuations, highlighting significant issues.
- **Integrated Feedback:** Seamlessly incorporates real-world insights into your development cycle.
- **End-to-End Visibility:** Clear, visual tracking of your AI application’s performance—from prompt design to production.

## Getting Started

- **Quick Installation:** Get up and running with a few lines of code.
- **Comprehensive Docs:** Use our Quickstart Guide and detailed documentation to integrate Galileo smoothly.
