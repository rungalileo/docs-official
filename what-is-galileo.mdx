Galileo is an **AI evaluation and observability platform** built specifically for developers building complex AI applications. It addresses the inherent challenges of generative AI—where the same input can yield different outputs—making it hard to pin down quality and troubleshoot issues.

## The Challenge

<DefinitionCard>
  **AI applications** introduce a unique set of challenges that traditional testing methods _simply cannot address_.
</DefinitionCard>

When building AI applications, even when you feed the exact same input into your system, you might receive a range of different outputs, complicating the process of defining what _**"correct"** even means_. This variability makes it difficult to establish consistent benchmarks and increases the complexity of debugging when something goes awry.

Moreover, as the underlying models and data are updated and evolve, application behavior can shift unexpectedly, rendering previously successful tests obsolete. This dynamic environment requires tools that not only measure performance accurately but also adapt to ongoing changes, all while providing clear, actionable insights 
into the AI's behavior across its entire lifecycle.

## How Galileo Helps

  <Card title="Identify Issues with Powerful Metrics" icon="magnifying-glass-chart" horizontal>
    Quickly pinpoint problematic responses using both built-in and custom metrics. Galileo provides comprehensive analytics across multiple dimensions, from correctness and completeness to safety and relevance. Detailed traces and token-level highlighting help you diagnose root causes, implement targeted fixes, and continuously iterate on your AI applications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Run Experiments with Structured Datasets" icon="flask" horizontal>
    Systematically evaluate your AI system using organized datasets that target specific scenarios and edge cases. Create focus sets for regression testing, compare performance across different inputs, and track improvements over time. Galileo's dataset management tools help you build comprehensive test suites that grow with your application and prevent regressions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test and Compare Multiple Approaches" icon="code-compare" horizontal>
    Methodically evaluate different models, prompts, and pipeline configurations side-by-side with quantifiable metrics. Galileo's experimentation framework lets you run controlled tests to measure the impact of changes, helping you make data-driven decisions when optimizing your AI systems. Compare results across multiple dimensions to confidently implement improvements.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Protect Applications with Runtime Guardrails" icon="shield-halved" horizontal>
    Safeguard your AI applications in production with real-time guardrails. Galileo's runtime metrics provide immediate visibility into model behavior, allowing you to set thresholds and implement protective measures that maintain quality and safety in your deployed AI systems.
