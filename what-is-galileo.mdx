Galileo is an **AI evaluation and observability platform** built specifically for developers building complex AI applications. It addresses the inherent challenges of generative AI—where the same input can yield different outputs—making it hard to pin down quality and troubleshoot issues.

> **Stay up to date:** Check our [Release Notes](./release-notes.md) for the latest features and improvements.

## The Challenge

<DefinitionCard>
  **AI applications** introduce a unique set of challenges that traditional testing methods _simply cannot address_.
</DefinitionCard>

When building AI applications, even when you feed the exact same input into your system, you might receive a range of different outputs, complicating the process of defining what _**"correct"** even means_. This variability makes it difficult to establish consistent benchmarks and increases the complexity of debugging when something goes awry.

Moreover, as the underlying models and data are updated and evolve, application behavior can shift unexpectedly, rendering previously successful tests obsolete. This dynamic environment requires tools that not only measure performance accurately but also adapt to ongoing changes, all while providing clear, actionable insights 
into the AI's behavior across its entire lifecycle.

## How Galileo Helps

  <Card title="Identify Issues with Powerful Metrics" icon="magnifying-glass-chart" horizontal>
    Pinpoint problems instantly with built-in and custom metrics. Get analytics across correctness, completeness, safety, and relevance dimensions. Use token-level highlighting to diagnose root causes and implement targeted fixes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Run Experiments with Structured Datasets" icon="flask" horizontal>
    Evaluate your AI with organized datasets targeting specific scenarios and edge cases. Build regression test suites, compare performance across inputs, and track improvements over time to prevent regressions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test and Compare Multiple Approaches" icon="code-compare" horizontal>
    Compare models, prompts, and configurations side-by-side with quantifiable metrics. Run controlled tests to measure the impact of changes and make data-driven decisions when optimizing your AI systems.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Protect Applications with Runtime Guardrails" icon="shield-halved" horizontal>
    Deploy real-time guardrails in production. Get immediate visibility into model behavior and set thresholds that maintain quality and safety in your live AI systems.
