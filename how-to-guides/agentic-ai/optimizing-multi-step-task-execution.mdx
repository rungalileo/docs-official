Agents sometimes fail to execute multi-step workflows effectively, leading to incomplete or disjointed actions that do not satisfy the task requirements.

## What Went Wrong?

- The agent did not execute steps in the correct order.
- Actions were taken prematurely or without necessary context.
- The agent failed to advance toward the final goal effectively.

## How It Showed Up in Metrics:

- **Low Action Advancement:** The agent did not progress meaningfully through the workflow.
- **High Tool Errors:** Steps executed out of order caused tool failures.
- **Low Tool Selection Quality:** The agent used tools inefficiently, leading to unnecessary steps.

## Improvements and Solutions

<Steps>
<Step title="Use Galileo's Metrics to Identify Execution Breakdowns">

- Analyze **Action Advancement** to detect where the agent is failing to progress.
- Examine **Tool Selection Quality** to find missteps in tool use.
- Track **Tool Errors** to determine if failures occur due to improper sequencing.

</Step>
<Step title="Enforce Logical Task Sequencing">

- Use **chain-of-thought prompting** to guide multi-step reasoning.
- Clearly specify dependencies between actions.
- Adjust workflow based on insights from **Action Advancement** metrics.

</Step>
<Step title="Optimize Multi-Step Planning">

- Implement step validation before moving to the next action.
- Use feedback loops to correct errors dynamically.
- Adjust prompts based on **Tool Selection Quality** and **Action Advancement** trends in Galileo.

</Step>
<Step title="Monitor and Iterate with Galileo">

- Compare different workflow strategies using **Action Advancement** metrics.
- Track improvements in **Tool Selection Quality** and **Tool Errors** over iterations.
- Implement continuous monitoring to detect regressions in workflow execution.
