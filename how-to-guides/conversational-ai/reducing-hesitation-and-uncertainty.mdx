Some models struggle to confidently generate responses, leading to hesitation, incomplete answers, or repeated disclaimers.

### What Went Wrong?
- Did not provide enough context for confident decision-making
- Allowed too much randomness in token selection
- Prompt structure was ambiguous

### How It Showed Up in Metrics:
- **High Uncertainty**: The model hesitated in its response
- **High Prompt Perplexity**: The model struggled with predicting the next token
- **Mid-range Instruction Adherence**: The model understood the instructions but lacked decisiveness

### Example of the Bad Setup

```
Prompt: "Tell me about climate change." 

Model Response: "Well, there are many aspects to climate change. Some people think it's caused by humans, and others think it's just natural. It's hard to say exactly."
```

## Improvements and Solutions
<Steps>
<Step title="Provide Stronger Context in Prompts">

- Include explicit guiding statements, for example:

  ```
  Instruction: Assume the following is true: Climate change is driven by human activity. 
  Provide an explanation based on scientific evidence.
  ```
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Model Sampling Parameters">

- Lower **temperature** to make the model more deterministic
- Use **top-k sampling** to limit options and prevent hesitation
</Step>
<Step title="Modify Prompt Structure">

- Use direct phrasing to force a single, clear response
- Avoid prompts that allow multiple equally valid answers
</Step>
<Step title="Apply Uncertainty-Based Filtering">

- Automatically reject responses with an **Uncertainty** score above a set threshold
</Step>
